long,How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ?,['d000.s000.t000'],['long%3:00:02::'],['of relatively great height; - Sherwood Anderson'],"Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.
A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye. Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator sport.
Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume (""game of the palm""), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style.
He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game – and most importantly you had his rules.
Tennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships date to 1891, although until 1925 they were open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs.
C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences.
In 1968, commercial pressures and rumours of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their living from tennis.
Tournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.
The line that runs across the centre of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side.
A legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server's court, before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net.
A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving.
The score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first.
If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played.
If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6) a tiebreak is played.
A tiebreak, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6.
If a tiebreak is not played, the set is referred to as an advantage set, where the set continues without limit until one player leads by a two-game margin.
On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments.
In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches.
In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase ""Game, set, match"" followed by the winning person's or team's name.
A game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game.
For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40–love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game.
Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.
The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points.
Match tiebreaks are used in the Hopman Cup, Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.
""Australian doubles"", another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the Canadian doubles style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game, each player taking a turn at playing alone against the other two.
As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving.
Wheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility.
Should a player be deemed to be stalling repeatedly, the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of ""point"", ""game"", and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit.
In the event of a rain delay, darkness or other external conditions halting play, the match is resumed at a later time, with the same score as at the time of the delay, and each player at the same end of the court as when rain halted play, or as close to the same relative compass point if play is resumed on a different court.
Balls wear out quickly in serious play and, therefore, in ATP and WTA tournaments, they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games, because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up.
This has been introduced in women's tennis for WTA Tour events in 2009 and allows the player to request her coach once per set.
It is commonly used in modern tennis especially by ‘top professional players on the forehand’.
Competent tennis players have eight basic shots in their repertoire: the serve, forehand, backhand, volley, half-volley, overhead smash, drop shot, and lob.
Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve.
A difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player.
Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net.
There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis.
In November at the end of the tennis year, the world's top eight players compete in the ATP Finals, a tournament with a rotating locale.
These tournaments also contribute towards a player's ATP rankings points.
In the Open Era, several female players such as Martina Navratilova, Margaret Court, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams, and Venus Williams (the latter two sisters playing together) have been prolific at both singles and doubles events throughout their careers.
The Open Era, particularly the men's side, has seen many top-ranked singles players that only sparingly compete in doubles, while having ""doubles specialists"" who are typically being eliminated early in the singles draw but do well in the doubles portion of a tournament.
Unlike professional tennis tournaments (see below) where singles players receive much more prize money than doubles players, an Olympic medal for both singles and doubles has similar prestige.
In professional tennis tournaments such as Wimbledon, the singles competition receives the most prize money and coverage, followed by doubles, and then mixed doubles usually receive the lowest monetary awards.
A frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time.
Andre Agassi, was the first player to complete the Career Grand Slam on all modern three surfaces (hard, grass, and clay courts) as previous winners of Grand Slam tournaments played in an era of grass and clay only (Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall also won major Pro tournaments on the three surfaces).
In March 2012 the Tennis Channel published a combined list of the 100 greatest men and women tennis players of all time.
Sportswriter John Wertheim of Sports Illustrated stated in an article in July 2010 that Serena Williams is the greatest female tennis player ever with the argument that ""Head-to-head, on a neutral surface (i.e. hard courts), everyone at their best, I can't help feeling that she crushes the other legends."".
In a reaction to this article Yahoo sports blog Busted Racket published a list of the top-10 women's tennis players of all time placing Martina Navratilova in first spot.
Billie Jean King said in 1999, ""Steffi is definitely the greatest women's tennis player of all time."" Martina Navratilova has included Graf on her list of great players.
Tennis writer Steve Flink, in his book The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century, named her as the best female player of the 20th century, directly followed by Martina Navratilova.
Tennis historian and journalist Bud Collins has called Navratilova ""arguably, the greatest player of all time."" Billie Jean King said about Navratilova in 2006, ""She's the greatest singles, doubles and mixed doubles player who's ever lived.""
In 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena Williams as the greatest female tennis player in the Open Era. In May 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of all time.
In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tiebreak to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review.
When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact.
These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.
Overuse is also common in tennis players of all levels.

Cháng Jiāng (长江; 長江) or ""Long River"" is the official name for the Yangtze in Mandarin Chinese.
By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as Kiang; Dajiang, e.g., was rendered as ""Ta-Kiang."" ""Keeang-Koo,"" ""Kyang Kew,"" ""Kian-ku,"" and related names derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (江口, p Jiāngkǒu) as the name of the river itself.
The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately 325 km (202 mi) southeast of Geladandong.
Four of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River.
Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.
The Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan.
What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the ""Yue"" people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions – blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves – and were considered barbarous by the northerners.
Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.
Since the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China's economy.
The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing).
The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.
Historically, the Yangtze was the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because crossing the river was difficult.
The China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo.
Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898.
Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.
Tens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes.
From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province.
In the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15 million homeless and $26 billion in economic loss.
In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.
In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes.
Until 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai.
It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.
The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway.
By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.
As of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW.
The Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries.
The Yangtze River has a high species richness, including many endemics.
178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin.
Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin).
About 2⁄3 of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin, but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin.
Due to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander.
""Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins."" It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.
The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt.
The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to 1,400 km (870 mi) up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range.

In the U.S., the word ""professor"" is often used to refer to anyone who teaches at a college of university level at any academic rank.
Other tenure-track faculty positions include assistant professor (entry level) and associate professor (mid-level).
Other teaching-focused positions that use the term ""professor"" include Clinical Professor, Professor of Practice, and Teaching Professor (specific roles and status vary widely among institutions, but usually do not involve tenure).
In the United States, while ""Professor"" as a proper noun (with a capital ""P"") generally implies a position title officially bestowed by a university or college to faculty members with a PhD or the highest level terminal degree in a non-academic field (e.g., MFA, MLIS), the common noun ""professor"" is often used casually to refer to anyone teaching at the college level, regardless of rank or degree.
After 7 years, in most American colleges and universities, a tenure-track faculty member (usually assistant professor) must be either awarded tenure, or dismissed from the university.
Educators who hold a formal title of ""Professor"" (referred to as tenured/tenure-track faculty) typically begin their careers as assistant professors (or ""lecturers"" and ""senior lecturers""), with subsequent promotions to the ranks of associate professor and finally professor.
The decision to grant tenure and promotion from assistant to associate professor usually requires numerous levels of approval, with a common sequence being:
Individuals in these positions who typically (though not always) focus on teaching undergraduate courses do not engage in research (except in the case of ""research professors""), may or may not have administrative or service roles, and sometimes are eligible for job security that is less strong than tenure.
Collegiate professor, teaching professor, or clinical professor (with or without ranks): More recent titles with many different variations, sometimes dependent upon rank; these instructors may hold parallel ranks as their tenure-track counterparts (i.e., teaching assistant professor, teaching associate professor, and (full) teaching professor) at institutions whose policy is to only provide ""tenure"" to those who do research.
(These are often known as ""soft money"" positions.) Accordingly, research professor positions usually are not eligible to be awarded tenure, but may still have ranks parallel to tenure-track counterparts (e.g. assistant, associate, and full levels).
Visiting professor (with or without ranks): (a) A temporary assistant/associate/full professor position (see above), e.g. to cover the teaching load of a faculty member on sabbatical.
Although the term ""professor"" is often used to refer to any college or university teacher, there are different 'tiers' of professorship ranging from an entry-level position as an ""assistant professor"" to ""full professor"", a rank reserved for professors who have established themselves as experts within their academic fields.
As they progress in their established fields through research, teaching, and service, they can make bids for promotion and tenure, which typically elevates them to the rank of associate professor.
College and university teachers who hold the rank of lecturer or instructor are typically not tenured/tenure-track faculty, usually focus on teaching undergraduate courses, and are generally not involved in research, nor are they typically involved in department and university decision-making.
The rank of assistant professor generally is held for a probationary period of five to seven years, after which the individual will either be promoted to associate professor and granted tenure (i.e., cannot be fired without cause and a formal hearing process) or will be terminated from employment.
Rates for achieving tenure vary, depending on the institutions and areas of study; in most places at least 50% of assistant professors will eventually become tenured and promoted to associate professors; however, this number can be as low as 10% in natural sciences departments of top universities or in non-PhD-granting schools.
Upon successfully receiving tenure, an assistant professor usually is promoted to the rank of associate professor.
If an applicant is appointed to the rank of associate professor without tenure, the position is usually tenure-track with an expectation that the person will soon qualify for tenure.
At some institutions, individuals are promoted to the rank of associate professor prior to receiving tenure.
Often specific to one institution, titles such as ""president's professor"", ""university professor"", ""distinguished professor"", ""distinguished research professor"", ""distinguished teaching professor"", ""distinguished university professor"", or ""regents professor"" are granted to a small percentage of the top tenured faculty who are regarded as particularly important in their respective fields of research.
Adding to the confusion over the formal names of non-tenure track positions, in almost every case the common-noun descriptor ""professor"" is used informally for people who teach at a college or university, regardless of their formal job title, and the terms are often loosely interchanged by faculty and administrators.
For example, at the University of Iowa, the ranks are adjunct instructor, adjunct assistant professor, adjunct associate professor, and adjunct full professor; the University states that ""the expectations at each rank are similar to those for the same rank on the tenure track"".
In parallel with tenure-track faculty ranks, there are assistant and associate research professor positions."

The term eisteddfod, which is formed from the Welsh morphemes: eistedd, meaning 'sit', and fod, meaning 'be', means, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, ""sitting-together."" Edwards further defines the earliest form of the eisteddfod as a competitive meeting between bards and minstrels, in which the winner was chosen by a noble or royal patron.
During his two 20th-century terms as Archdruid of the Gorsedd Cymru, Albert Evans-Jones, whose bardic name was Cynan and who was a war poet and minister of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, created new rituals for both the Gorsedd and the eisteddfod which are based upon the Christian beliefs of the Welsh people rather than upon Modern Druidry.
Since its 18th-century revival, the eisteddfod tradition has been carried all over the world by the Welsh diaspora.
Today's eisteddfodau (plural form) and the National Eisteddfod of Wales in particular, are in equal parts a Renaissance fair, a Celtic festival, a musical festival, a literary festival, and ""the supreme exhibition of the Welsh culture."": 52 
In some other countries, the term eisteddfod is used for performing arts competitions that have nothing to do with Welsh culture or the Welsh language.
The proclamation is to read as follows, ""When the year of Our Lord ----, and the period of the Gorsedd of the Bards of Britain within the summer solstice, after summons and invitation to all to all of Wales through the Gorsedd Trumpet, under warning of a year and a day, in sight and hearing of lords and commons and in the face of the sun, the eye of light, be it known that a Gorsedd and Eisteddfod will be held at the town of ----, where protections will be afforded to all who seek privilege, dignity, and license in Poetry and Minstrelsy...
And thither shall come the Archdruid and the Gorsedd and others, Bards and Licensiates of the Privilege and Robe of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, there to hold judgment of Chair and Gorsedd on Music and Poetry concerning the muse, conduct, and learning of all that may come to seek the National Eisteddfod honours, according to the privilege and customs of the Gorsedd of Bards of the Isle of Britain:
Also according to Morris, ""the Eisteddfod is essentially competitive: there are competitions for penillion, and englynion, and male voice choirs, and poems in strict meter, and poems in free metre, and essays, and translations, and plays, and short stories."" Also, according to Morris, ""outside the Pabell Lên, the Literary Tent, poets mutter couplets to themselves, or exchange bitter Bardic complaints."": 156-157 
To win the chair or the crown competitions, particularly at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, grants even previously unknown poets and writers enormous publicity and prestige.
At the National Eisteddfod, a Gold Medal (Welsh: Medal Aur) is annually awarded in three categories; Fine Art, Architecture, and Craft and Design.
According to legend, Gruffudd ap Cynan (1055–1137), the Dublin-born King of Gwynedd from the House of Aberffraw and the descendant of Rhodri Mawr, Sigtrygg Silkbeard, and Brian Boru, not only reformed the Welsh bardic schools to accord with those that trained the Irish language bards, but also served as patron to an eisteddfod at Caerwys during his reign.: 9 
When asked about Turvey's theory, recognized eisteddfod historian Hywel Teifi Edwards said, ""It's conjecture, but there's no doubt that there was a bardic tradition of competition for status before this time."" Edwards further stated that any foreign influence was an indication of how very cosmopolitan Medieval Wales had been.
At the eisteddfod the Cadair Arian ('Silver Chair'), which is said to have been fashioned by Gruffudd ap Nicolas himself, was won by a cywydd in honour of the Holy Trinity composed by Dafydd ab Edmwnd, a Welsh poet who did not depend on noble patronage, from Hanmer, Flintshire.: 6-8  Welsh poet and Roman Catholic priest Llawdden, however, accused Gruffudd ap Nicolas of accepting a bribe from Dafydd ab Edmwnd in return for the Silver Chair.
In 1523, an eisteddfod was held at Caerwys under King Henry VIII's charter and was led by Welsh bard and future Franciscan friar, Tudur Aled.
The Statute listed the rights of bards in Welsh culture and under traditional Welsh law, while also arguing that bards should not drink to excess, womanize, or gamble.: 8–10  In addition, the Statute further stated that a true bard must never write satirical poetry: 28–29  and codified the rules of praise poetry at a time when the Welsh bardic tradition of was increasingly under threat and, ""demanded that the bard celebrate in elevated language the orderliness of a God-centered world."": 8–10
Despite their battles similar to his own against government censorship, Sir Philip Sidney, in An Apology for Poetry, expressed both admiration for and evny of the prestige that poets enjoyed in Welsh culture, which he contrasted with what he described as the Elizabethan era tendency in English culture to treat poets as unwanted stepchildren, ""In Wales, the true remnant of the ancient Brittons, as there are good authorities to show, the long time they had poets which they called Bards: so through all the conquests of Romans, Saxons, Danes, and Normans, some of whom, did seek to ruin all memory of learning from among them, yet do their poets even to this day last: so as it is not more notable in the soon beginning, then in long continuing.""
Even though there is a major difference between Cymraeg Llenyddol and all 21st century spoken dialects of the Welsh language, eisteddfod submissions are still required to be composed in the literary language of Bishop Morgan's Bible, which remains the foundation upon which all subsequent Welsh literature has been built.
According to Marcus Tanner, Queen Elizabeth I's experiment at royal patronage of the eisteddfod did not catch on and, as the 16th and 17th centuries progressed, the Welsh nobility became increasingly Anglicized and ceased to grant employment or hospitality to Welsh-language poets.
Although eisteddfodau continued, the gatherings became more informal; Welsh poets would often meet in taverns, cemeteries, or inns to have ""assemblies of rhymers"".: 192  But the interest of the Welsh people dwindled to such a point that the eisteddfod held at Glamorgan in 1620 attracted an audience of only four people.: 192  The winners, however, continued to receive a chair, which was a highly prized award because of its perceived social status.
In 1701, an eisteddfod was held at Machynlleth in order, ""To begin to renew the eisteddfod of bards (as they were in olden times), to reprimand false cynghanedd, to explain the difficult things, and to confirm what is correct in the art of poetry in the Welsh language."": 12 
Although the Gwyneddigion did not succeed in their ambition of transforming the eisteddfod ""into an Academy that would act as a forcing house for Welsh culture"", they have wielded considerable influence over continued requirement for long poems as eisteddfod submissions.: 14  Furthermore, in reaction to the incomprehensibility of Welsh poetry composed in strict meter, the Gwyneddigion held up the recent poetry of Reverend Goronwy Owen as a better model.: 14–15 
Owen felt, however, that the rules of Welsh poetry in strict meter prevented him from doing so.: 14–15  Therefore, by holding Owen up as a model, the Gwyneddigion ensured that his literary legacy is that, as late as 1930, both the adjudicators and the poets composing submissions to the National Eisteddfod of Wales were aspiring to produce the Welsh national epic that Owen had longed to write in vain.: 29–31 
According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, while the awarding of a chair is a very old tradition, the now-familiar ceremony of the chairing of the bard who has composed the best awdl dates from the eisteddfod revival of the early 1790s.: 15 
During the 1790 eisteddfod held at St. Asaph, Gwyneddigion Society member Edward Williams, whose bardic name was Iolo Morganwg, became convinced that he and his fellow Welsh poets were the descendants of the Druids and that the eisteddfod was a survival of Druidic ritual.
In 1858 John Williams, whose bardic name was Ab Ithel, held a ""national"" eisteddfod with the Gorsedd Cymru in Llangollen.
A writer for The Times went even farther, calling the eisteddfod ""simply foolish interference with the natural progress of civilization and prosperity – it is a monstrous folly to encourage the Welsh in a loving fondness for their old language."": 155 
Before the 1858 Llangollen eisteddfod was over, however, a meeting of Welsh literati had taken place and decided that an annual national eisteddfod, conducted with due regard for standards, was long overdue.
The Welsh poet Lewis William Lewis (1831–1901), whose bardic name was Llew Llwyfo, repeatedly attempted in his eisteddfod submissions to, ""achieve the national epic that would merit translation into the major literatures"".
Although Edwards is very critical of Llew Llwyfo and accuses him of following the then common practice of imitating Victorian-era English poetry,: 30-31  Lewis' poetry repeatedly won first prize at multiple eisteddfodau held both in Wales and within Welsh-American immigrant communities.
Even though the title had been previously chosen by the eisteddfod judges, almost certainly in the hope of inspiring a Welsh equivalent to Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King, Thomas Gwynn Jones' hugely influential awdl, Ymadawiad Arthur (""The Passing of Arthur"") won its author the bardic chair at the National Eisteddfod in 1902.
It was the award of the bardic chair during the second day of the 1917 National Eisteddfod of Wales at Birkenhead Park in the English city of the same name.
Mab y Bwthyn ""tells, in a gushingly romantic, lyrical style how a young gwerinwr, scarred by the horrors of war, turns from the fetid city to seek spiritual renewal in the natural beauty of his home and the love of a pure country girl."" Cynan's poem has been called the best-loved pryddest ever composed during the 20th century and many Welsh people, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, are still able to recite long passages of it from memory.: 59-60  Alan Llwyd, who has translated part of Mab y Bwthyn into English for the 2008 book Out of the Fire of Hell: Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914–1918 in Prose and Verse, has argued that Cynan, rather than the far more famous Hedd Wyn, is the greatest Welsh war poet.
Plaid Cymru, a Welsh nationalist and social democratic political party, was founded during the 1925 National Eisteddfod at Pwllheli, Gwynedd.
At the 1936 National Eisteddfod held at Fishguard (Welsh: Abergwaun), the set title for the Bardic Crown was Yr Anialwch ('The Wasteland'), which was almost certainly inspired by T.S. Eliot's famous Modernist poem of the same name.
In 1985, the long-term effects of Saunders Lewis' Tynged yr Iaith were listed by Gwyn Williams: the formation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg in 1962, direct action against English-language offices, roadsigns, and TV masts, sit-ins and demonstrations, Welsh-language schools, the 1973 adoption of adult education in the Welsh language based upon the Ulpan system created in the State of Israel for teaching the Hebrew language and Israeli culture to adult immigrants, the 1964 creation of the office of Secretary of State for Wales, the 1967 passing of the Welsh Language Act, the creation of S4C, and the mushrooming of Welsh-language publishing, film production, pop and rock, as well as youth and urban music.
He was also the first Archdruid to accept that the Gorsedd is an 18th-century invention by Iolo Morganwg and that it has no links to Welsh mythology or to the ancient Druids, thus healing rifts between the academic and ecclesiastical establishments and the eisteddfod movement.
Cynan is also responsible for designing the modern ceremonies of the crowning and chairing of the bard in the eisteddfod as they are now performed, by creating ceremonies which, he thought, better reflected the Christian beliefs of the Welsh people.
Although it has been held since 1929, the most notable event in the history of the Welsh youth festival known as the Urdd National Eisteddfod took place at Aberystwyth, also in 1969.
The fallout afterwards was heated and an editorial in the Welsh-language newspaper Y Cymro severely angered the director of the Urdd National Eisteddfod.
In 1999 the centenary of early Gaelic revival poet and Easter Rising leader Patrick Pearse's initiation into the Gorsedd at the 1899 Pan Celtic Eisteddfod in Cardiff (where he took the Bardic name of Areithiwr) was marked by the unveiling of a plaque at the Consulate General of the Irish Republic in Wales.
In a ceremony held entirely in the Welsh language during the 2002 National Eisteddfod at St. David's, Rowan Williams, the Anglican Archbishop of Wales, was sworn into the Gorsedd as a ""White Druid"" under the bardic name ""Ap Aneurin"".
During the 2018 National Eisteddfod at Cardiff, the bardic crown was awarded to poet and Welsh nationalist Catrin Dafydd, born in Gwaelod y Garth, for her collection Olion (""Traces"").
The most important is the National Eisteddfod of Wales, the largest festival of competitive music and poetry in Europe.
Among the elements from Welsh culture that travelled with these émigrés was the eisteddfod, which – in a variety of forms and languages – continues to exist worldwide.
Although eisteddfodau have been held in Argentina ever since the first Welsh immigrants arrived aboard the Mimosa in 1865, assimilation and the loss of contact with the homeland caused both the distinctive Patagonian dialect of the Welsh language and the eisteddfod tradition to be seriously endangered.
Williams won the Bardic Chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in both 1964 and 1968, and from 1975 to 1978 he served as Archdruid of the Gorsedd Cymru.
Current eisteddfod competitions are bilingual, in both Patagonian Welsh and Argentine Spanish, and include poetry, prose, literary translations (Welsh, Spanish, English, Italian, and French), musical performances, arts, folk dances, photography, and filmmaking, among others.
Eisteddfods (Australian English: plural) in the traditional Welsh sense have also been adopted into Australian culture.
During the subsequent revival of the eisteddfod, the Gwyneddigion Society held up the poetry of Owen as an example for bards at future eisteddfodau to emulate.
During the eisteddfod revival of the 1790s, Gwyneddigion Society member William Jones, who had enthusiastically supported the American Revolution and who was arguing for the creation of a National Eisteddfod of Wales, had come to believe that the completely Anglicized Welsh nobility, through rackrenting and their employment of unscrupulous land agents, had forfeited all right to the obedience and respect of their tenants.
Local Welsh-language poet James Price, whose bardic name was Ap Dewi ('Son of David'), was born at Newark, Ohio to parents from Llanon, Ceredigion.: 254  After migrating to the Minnesota frontier, Ap Dewi served as a deacon and Sunday school teacher at the Horeb Calvinistic Methodist Church in Cambria Township, Blue Earth County: 64  and was so dominant at local eisteddfodau that he was considered the ""prifardd of Minnesota."": 138 
The first Welsh literary society in Minnesota was founded, according to Ap Dewi, at a meeting held in South Bend Township, also in Blue Earth County in the fall of 1855.: 129  Also according to Ap Dewi, ""The first eisteddfod in the state of Minnesota was held in Judson in the house of Wm. C.
Jones, a Calvinistic Methodist minister born at Ty Rhedyn, near Marian-glas, Anglesey and Welsh-language writer whose literary talents drew comparisons with Washington Irving,: 215-216  the first eisteddfod held in Cambria Township took place on the Fourth of July, 1871.
The first eisteddfod held in the Twin Cities took place, ""on a fairly large scale"", and sponsored by the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis, on 17 January 1885.: 210-211 
A third Minneapolis eisteddfod was held, under the patronage of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel and Y Wyddorfa, the Welsh literary society of Minneapolis, on St. David's Day, 1894.
Also during the American Civil War, Edward Thomas, a Welsh-language poet born in Centerville, Ohio to parents from Llanidloes and whose bardic name was Awenydd, was living and working as a schoolmaster at the Welsh-American farming settlement at South Bend Township, in Blue Earth County, Minnesota.
During his service in that regiment, Thomas wrote many Welsh-language poems, including Pryddest ar Wir Fawredd, which later won the bardic crown at an eisteddfod held in Minersville, Pennsylvania.
At the same eisteddfod, Reverend Evan Reese, a Calvinistic Methodist minister from Puncheston, Pembrokeshire, and Welsh poet whose bardic name was Dyfed, won the bardic chair and the $500 prize money offered for a 2,000 line awdl on the set subject Iesu o Nazareth ('Jesus of Nazareth').: 31  Reese went on to become the Archdruid of the Gorsedd Cymru and to announce the posthumous victory of Hedd Wyn at the infamous 1917 Eisteddfod of the Black Chair.
The 2011 West Coast Eisteddfod event was co-curated by Lorin Morgan-Richards and held at the Barnsdall Art Park in Los Angeles, the site of Welsh-American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House, near Griffith Park, founded by Welsh-American philanthropist Griffith J.
Welsh Heritage Week and Cwrs Cymraeg, two ambulatory Welsh language and culture courses held annually, usually in the United States, also each feature a mini-eisteddfod.
The North American Festival of Wales held by the Welsh North American Association also includes an eisteddfod.
Even though the neo-bardic, Gorsedd, and Eisteddfod movement in Brittany was founded during the early 19th century by Auguste Brizeux, the real heyday of the movement took place between 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War. Those two decades were dominated by François Jaffrenou, whose bardic name was Taldir, and who introduced many Iolo Morganwg-inspired elements of Welsh culture into Breton culture and literature.
Since it was founded as part of the Gaelic revival by Conradh na Gaeilge in 1897, the eisteddfod-inspired festival known as Oireachtas na Gaeilge was envisaged to spearhead a renaissance of Irish-language literature, culture, and the arts.
Since it was also founded by Conradh na Gaeilge in 1902, Seachtain na Gaeilge (English: Irish Language Week), which is similarly based upon the Welsh eisteddfod, has celebrated Irish traditional music, Gaelic games, and Irish culture.
After the end of the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Civil War, the 1924-1937 revival of the ancient Tailteann Games also emulated the Welsh Eisteddfod by including ceremonies in Pre-Christian Irish clothing and inspired by Irish mythology.
The Scottish Gaelic mòd, a festival of Scottish Gaelic song, literature, arts and culture, is modeled upon the Welsh eisteddfod.
In response, An Comunn Gàidhealach was founded at Oban in 1891 to help preserve the Scottish Gaelic language and its literature and to establish the Royal National Mòd (Am Mòd Nàiseanta Rìoghail), as a festival of Gaelic music, literature, arts, and culture deliberately modelled upon the National Eisteddfod of Wales.
According to Ronald Black, ""In 1923, following the example of the Welsh Eisteddfod, An Commun Gàidhealach simplified the structure of its annual poetry competitions into a single contest for a Bardic Crown (Scottish Gaelic: Crùn na Bàrdachd), the winner to be acknowledged as Bard of An Commun (Scottish Gaelic: Bàird a' Chomuinn Gàidhealaich) for the coming year.
The 1992 Welsh-language biographical film Hedd Wyn focuses on war poet Ellis Humphrey Evans' (Huw Garmon) pursuit of his lifelong dream of winning the bardic chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and on his three-year-long battle against overwhelming pressure to enlist in the British Army during World War I.

Chairs vary in design.
They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today's chairs – chair seats were sometimes only 10 inches (25 cm) high.
In some cases, multiple materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic.
Some chairs have foot rests.
The popliteal height, after adjusting for heels, clothing and other issues, is used to determine the height of the chair seat.
In general, if the occupant is supposed to sit for a long time, weight needs to be taken off the seat area and thus ""easy"" chairs intended for long periods of sitting are generally at least slightly reclined.
The back of the chair will support some of the weight of the occupant, reducing the weight on other parts of the body.
Reclining chairs typically have at least shoulder-height back-rests to shift weight to the shoulders.
Types of chairs
Office chair
Work chair
Rocking chair
Kneeling chair
A sit-stand chair distributes most of the weight of the occupant to the feet.
Many chairs are padded or have cushions.
Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have.
Center seats where a solid material forms the chair seat

Between 2007 and 2013, EU regional policy consisted of three objectives: Convergence, Regional competitiveness and employment, and European territorial cooperation; the previous three objectives (from 2000 to 2006) were simply known as Objectives 1, 2 and 3.
In its long-term budget, the EU's Cohesion policy gives particular attention to regions where economic development is below the EU average.
It is intended to strengthen the European regions, promote territorial integration and produce coherence of European Union (EU) policies so as to contribute to the sustainable development and global competitiveness of the EU.
These regions received transitional, ""phasing out"" support during the previous funding period of 2007–13.
Bulgaria – all (except Southwestern region)
Bulgaria – Southwestern region
The cohesion policy accounts for almost one third of the EU's budget, equivalent to almost EUR 352 billion over seven years in 2014-2020, and EUR 392 billion in 2021-2027, dedicated to the promotion of economic development and job creation, and for helping communities and nations get ready for the European Union's transition to a more sustainable and digital economy.
Sustainable energy and natural resources accounted for €10.2 billion, or 34% of overall European Investment Bank cohesion loans, compared to 26% for non-cohesion regions.
There are two structural funds available to all EU regions: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF).
In the 2014–2020 funding period, money is allocated differently between regions that are deemed to be ""more developed"" (with GDP per capita over 90% of the EU average), ""transition"" (between 75% and 90%), and ""less developed"" (less than 75%), and additional funds are set aside for member states with GNI per capita under 90 percent of the EU average in the Cohesion Fund.
Funding for less developed regions, like the Convergence objective before it, aims to allow the regions affected to catch up with the EU's more prosperous regions, thereby reducing economic disparity within the European Union.
Regional policy projects in less developed regions are supported by three European funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has pledged to increasing its support for certain regions in its Cohesion Orientation for 2021–2027.
For the EU as a whole, the European Investment Bank invested €16.2 billion in climate action and environmental sustainability in 2022 in cohesion areas.

By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the unemployment benefit program.
Unemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the Second World War with the expansion of the welfare state.
Some countries allow beneficiaries to accept part-time jobs without losing benefit eligibility, which can counter the disincentive of unemployment benefits to accepting jobs that do not fully replace the former wages.
Unemployment benefits are typically funded by payroll taxes on employers and employees.
To receive a JobSeeker Payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one's income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home).
Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job.
Each Member State of the European Union has its own system and, in general, a worker should claim unemployment benefits in the country where they last worked.
Regardless of whether benefits are paid by Kela or from an unemployment fund, the unemployed person receives assistance from the Työ- ja elinkeinokeskus (TE-keskus, or the ""Work and Livelihood Centre""), a government agency which helps people to find jobs and employers to find workers.
The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of €162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or €6900 per month.
Type I unemployment benefits are only granted for a limited period of time, the minimum being 6 months, with a maximum of 24 months in the case of old and long-term insured people.
Unemployment benefits in Greece are administered through OAED (Greek: Οργανισμός Απασχόλησης Εργατικού Δυναμικού, Manpower Employment Organization) and are available only to laid-off salaried workers with full employment and social security payments during the previous two years.
In terms of an unemployment allowance, Greece allows for those found in unemployment, who are employed through an independent profession, to receive benefits if their latest paycheck had not exceeded a certain amount, the current rate should not exceed €1,467.35.
Under the OAED, individuals who are benefiting from long-term unemployment must be within the ages of 20 to 66 years of age and have a family income that does not exceed €10,000 annually.
This low rate of unemployment is attributed to the adoption of the Ghent system, which has been adopted by the countries of Denmark, Finland and Sweden, and highly emphasizes trade and labour unions to provide unemployment benefits and protections to workers, which ultimately has led to higher union membership than other capitalist economies.
The country relies on an open capitalistic market for economic growth, yet also embraces a corporatist system that allows for wage bargaining to occur between the labour force and employers in order to protect workers and ensure provisions like unemployment benefits are ensured.
These rights for organized unions set forth by the Ministry of Welfare not only provide the country's labour force fair and equal representation within their respective industries, but also allow for these organizations to maintain an active relationship with the Icelandic government to discuss economic issues, promote labour and social equality, and ensure benefits for unemployed labourers, as these unions are highly centralized and not politically affiliated.
Unemployed workers can be compensated through either basic or income-linked benefits.
Basic unemployment benefits can cover both wage-earning and self-employing individuals for the first half-month (10 days) after they lose their job, whereas income-linked benefits can cover wage-earning and self-employing individuals for up to three months based on a set salary index and length of employment.
However, those who are unemployed must report to the Directorate of Labour once a month to reaffirm their status of unemployment and that they are actively searching for employment or unemployment benefits could be revoked.
India follows a social insurance system for unemployment benefits much like its European counterparts.
Unemployment allowance is given to workers in India who have contributed to the Employees' State Insurance for at least three years.
In Israel, unemployment benefits are paid by Bituah Leumi (National Insurance Institute), to which workers must pay contributions.
To be eligible for unemployment benefits, a person must be at least 20 years old, have been previously employed, and completed a ""qualifying period"" of work for which unemployment insurance contributions were paid which varies between 300 and 360 days.
Employees who were involuntarily terminated from their jobs or who terminated their own employment and can provide evidence of having done so for a justified reason are eligible for immediately receiving unemployment benefits, while those who are deemed to have terminated their employment of their own volition with no justified reason will only begin receiving unemployment benefits 90 days from the start of their unemployment period.
Unemployment benefits are paid daily, with the amount calculated based on the employee's previous income over the past six months, but not exceeding the daily average wage for the first 125 days of payment and two-thirds of the daily average wage from the 126th day onwards.
During the unemployment period, the Employment Service Bureau assists in helping locate suitable work and job training, and regularly reporting to the Employment Service Bureau is a condition for continuing to receive unemployment benefits.
A person who was offered suitable work or training by the Employment Service Bureau but refused will only receive unemployment benefits 90 days after the date of the refusal, and 30 days' worth of unemployment benefits will be deducted for each subsequent refusal.
In addition, there are unemployment benefits for new immigrants who have not yet been able to find employment or who are receiving below minimum wage pay.
The time period that they are qualified to receive unemployment benefits is during the first 12 months following their immigration to Israel.
Unemployment benefits in Japan are called ""unemployment insurance"" and are closer to the US or Canadian ""user pays"" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as Britain, New Zealand or Australia.
The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.
Mexico City Unemployment Benefit Scheme – The only unemployment insurance system based on worker contributions exists in Mexico City.
Unemployed residents of Mexico City who are at least 18 years of age, have worked for at least six months, have no income, and are actively seeking work are eligible for unemployment benefits for up to six months, which are composed of payments of 30 days' worth of minimum wage per month.
Workers older than 50 years who are unemployed for over 2 months are entitled to a special benefit called the IOAW, if they do not receive the regular unemployment benefit (WW).
In New Zealand, Jobseeker Support, previously known as the Unemployment Benefit and also known as ""the dole"" provides income support for people who are looking for work or training for work.
In the Philippines, workers in the private sector who involuntarily became unemployed, including housemaids and Overseas Filipino Workers, are entitled to benefits through the Social Security Act of 2018.
For government workers, unemployment benefits are sourced from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).
In Poland, the system is designed to prevent people from living off unemployment benefits long term, thus forcing them to work or rely on non-state means of support (family, charities).
In comparison to the unemployment benefits paid by the state, as of January 2019, the minimum monthly pay is 2250,00 zł (US$595.51 in April 2019) before taxes.
Contributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months' contributions over a period of six years preceding unemployment.
In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the municipality tax rate).
By law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment.
Though policies vary by state, unemployment benefits generally pay eligible workers as high as US$1,015 in Massachusetts to a low as US$235 per week maximum in Mississippi.
Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct (""terminated for cause"") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those who quit or who are fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not.
Though the participation rate varies by state from below 10% to above 60%, nationwide only 29% of unemployed Americans (those seeking work) received unemployment benefits.
A survey of studies on unemployment insurance's effect on employment by the Political Economy Research Institute found that unemployed who collected benefits did not find themselves out of work longer than those who did not have unemployment benefits; and that unemployed workers did not search for work more or reduce their wage expectations once their benefits ran out.
One concern over unemployment insurance increasing unemployment is based on experience rating benefit uses which can sometimes be imperfect.
Possible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses.
International Labour Organization has adopted the Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988 for promotion of employment against unemployment and social security including unemployment benefit.

More broadly, welfare may also encompass efforts to provide a basic level of well-being through subsidized social services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, vocational training, and public housing.
In a welfare state, the state assumes responsibility for the health, education, infrastructure and welfare of society, providing a range of social services such as those described.
The first welfare state was Imperial Germany (1871–1918), where the Bismarck government introduced social security in 1889.
In the early 20th century, the United Kingdom introduced social security around 1913, and adopted the welfare state with the National Insurance Act 1946, during the Attlee government (1944–1951).
In the countries of western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, social welfare is mainly provided by the government out of the national tax revenues, and to a lesser extent by non-government organizations (NGOs), and charities (social and religious).
The Song dynasty government (960 CE) supported multiple programs which could be classified as social welfare, including the state hospitals, low-interest loans for peasants, state orphanages, free pharmacies for the poor, filled state granaries, fire stations and libraries in the large cities, retirement homes, public clinics, and paupers' graveyards.
Modern welfare states include Germany, France, the Netherlands, as well as the Nordic countries, such as Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland which employ a system known as the Nordic model.
Social insurance, state-sponsored programs based partly on individual contributions towards benefits such as healthcare, unemployment payments, and old-age pensions.
While assistance is often in the form of financial payments, those eligible for social welfare can usually access health and educational services free of charge.
During the Second World War, Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for: child endowment in 1941 (superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme); a widows' pension in 1942 (superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme); a wife's allowance in 1943; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943; and unemployment, sickness, and special benefits in 1945 (superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme).
Canada has a welfare state in the European tradition; however, it is not referred to as ""welfare"", but rather as ""social programs"".
The social welfare is provided through social (including pension) insurance, sick insurance (not to be confused with health insurance), public policy related to unemployment and low income benefits, which are financed through the government budget, and health insurance, which is financed through an array of insurance companies.
Therefore, the social welfare program is usually separated into three categories: health insurance, social insurance and social benefits support.
Estonia does have a welfare state that provides a range of social services and financial assistance to its citizens.
The Estonian welfare state provides a range of services, including universal healthcare, free education, and a comprehensive system of social security.
It also provides financial assistance to citizens in need through programs such as unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and social assistance for low-income families.
The Estonian welfare state is funded through a mix of taxation and public spending, and it relies on a strong social security system to provide support to citizens in need.
The Finnish Nordic model welfare state is based on the principles of social equality and the belief that all citizens should have access to the same basic rights and opportunities.
It also provides financial assistance to citizens in need through programs such as unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and social assistance for low-income families.
The Finnish welfare state relies on a strong social security system to provide support to citizens in need.
Under Adolf Hitler, the National Socialist Program stated ""We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare."" Today, the social protection of all its citizens is considered a central pillar of German national policy.
The Government of India's social programmes and welfare expenditures are a substantial portion of the official budget, and state and local governments play roles in developing and implementing social security policies.
Social welfare, assistance for the ill or otherwise disabled and for the old, has long been provided in Japan by both the government and private companies.
New Welfare programs have integrated the multidimensional, social risk management, and capabilities approaches into poverty alleviation.
Norway has a strong welfare state that provides a range of social services and financial assistance to its citizens.
The Norwegian welfare state is based on the principles of social democracy, which means that it has a strong focus on reducing income inequality and promoting social cohesion.
The Norwegian welfare state provides a range of services, including universal healthcare, free education, and a comprehensive system of social security.
It also provides financial assistance to citizens in need through programs such as unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and social assistance for low-income families.
The Polish welfare state provides a range of services, including universal healthcare, free education, and a comprehensive system of social security.

The social policies implemented by the Spanish State, as in the rest of Europe, are a set of measures and tools aimed at protecting and ensuring basic human needs, especially in the field of education, health, and economic security.
The Mediterranean Welfare state model is found not only in Spain, but also in countries such as Italy, Greece and Portugal, countries in the Mediterranean region where social protection arrived late, in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century.
It is characterized as the welfare model with the lowest spending, with little investment in social assistance, a more fragmented social security system, and high spending on pensions, making pension benefits greater than unemployment benefits.
The Spanish social welfare program can be separated into three categories or fundamental pillars: education, health, and pension system, as established in the Spanish Constitution ratified on December 29, 1978.
The beginnings of the Spanish Welfare state date back to the last decade of dictatorship, Francoist Spain, when it began to develop through the Social Security Law of 1963.
The social policies of the Spanish State, like those of most countries in the world, are in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and, as the rest of the European Welfare States, also depend on the guidelines of a higher body, the European Union.
In Spain, the welfare state is considered to be very scarce and less developed, especially compared to the European Union average, where social policies and the welfare state are strongly developed.
In the United States, depending on the context, the term ""welfare"" can be used to refer to means-tested cash benefits, especially the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and its successor, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grants, or it can be used to refer to all means-tested programs that help individuals or families meet basic needs, including, for example, health care through Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and food and nutrition programs (SNAP)."

By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the unemployment benefit program.
Unemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the Second World War with the expansion of the welfare state.
Some countries allow beneficiaries to accept part-time jobs without losing benefit eligibility, which can counter the disincentive of unemployment benefits to accepting jobs that do not fully replace the former wages.
Unemployment benefits are typically funded by payroll taxes on employers and employees.
To receive a JobSeeker Payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one's income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home).
Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job.
Each Member State of the European Union has its own system and, in general, a worker should claim unemployment benefits in the country where they last worked.
Regardless of whether benefits are paid by Kela or from an unemployment fund, the unemployed person receives assistance from the Työ- ja elinkeinokeskus (TE-keskus, or the ""Work and Livelihood Centre""), a government agency which helps people to find jobs and employers to find workers.
The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of €162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or €6900 per month.
Type I unemployment benefits are only granted for a limited period of time, the minimum being 6 months, with a maximum of 24 months in the case of old and long-term insured people.
Unemployment benefits in Greece are administered through OAED (Greek: Οργανισμός Απασχόλησης Εργατικού Δυναμικού, Manpower Employment Organization) and are available only to laid-off salaried workers with full employment and social security payments during the previous two years.
In terms of an unemployment allowance, Greece allows for those found in unemployment, who are employed through an independent profession, to receive benefits if their latest paycheck had not exceeded a certain amount, the current rate should not exceed €1,467.35.
Under the OAED, individuals who are benefiting from long-term unemployment must be within the ages of 20 to 66 years of age and have a family income that does not exceed €10,000 annually.
This low rate of unemployment is attributed to the adoption of the Ghent system, which has been adopted by the countries of Denmark, Finland and Sweden, and highly emphasizes trade and labour unions to provide unemployment benefits and protections to workers, which ultimately has led to higher union membership than other capitalist economies.
The country relies on an open capitalistic market for economic growth, yet also embraces a corporatist system that allows for wage bargaining to occur between the labour force and employers in order to protect workers and ensure provisions like unemployment benefits are ensured.
These rights for organized unions set forth by the Ministry of Welfare not only provide the country's labour force fair and equal representation within their respective industries, but also allow for these organizations to maintain an active relationship with the Icelandic government to discuss economic issues, promote labour and social equality, and ensure benefits for unemployed labourers, as these unions are highly centralized and not politically affiliated.
Unemployed workers can be compensated through either basic or income-linked benefits.
Basic unemployment benefits can cover both wage-earning and self-employing individuals for the first half-month (10 days) after they lose their job, whereas income-linked benefits can cover wage-earning and self-employing individuals for up to three months based on a set salary index and length of employment.
However, those who are unemployed must report to the Directorate of Labour once a month to reaffirm their status of unemployment and that they are actively searching for employment or unemployment benefits could be revoked.
India follows a social insurance system for unemployment benefits much like its European counterparts.
Unemployment allowance is given to workers in India who have contributed to the Employees' State Insurance for at least three years.
In Israel, unemployment benefits are paid by Bituah Leumi (National Insurance Institute), to which workers must pay contributions.
To be eligible for unemployment benefits, a person must be at least 20 years old, have been previously employed, and completed a ""qualifying period"" of work for which unemployment insurance contributions were paid which varies between 300 and 360 days.
Employees who were involuntarily terminated from their jobs or who terminated their own employment and can provide evidence of having done so for a justified reason are eligible for immediately receiving unemployment benefits, while those who are deemed to have terminated their employment of their own volition with no justified reason will only begin receiving unemployment benefits 90 days from the start of their unemployment period.
Unemployment benefits are paid daily, with the amount calculated based on the employee's previous income over the past six months, but not exceeding the daily average wage for the first 125 days of payment and two-thirds of the daily average wage from the 126th day onwards.
During the unemployment period, the Employment Service Bureau assists in helping locate suitable work and job training, and regularly reporting to the Employment Service Bureau is a condition for continuing to receive unemployment benefits.
A person who was offered suitable work or training by the Employment Service Bureau but refused will only receive unemployment benefits 90 days after the date of the refusal, and 30 days' worth of unemployment benefits will be deducted for each subsequent refusal.
In addition, there are unemployment benefits for new immigrants who have not yet been able to find employment or who are receiving below minimum wage pay.
The time period that they are qualified to receive unemployment benefits is during the first 12 months following their immigration to Israel.
Unemployment benefits in Japan are called ""unemployment insurance"" and are closer to the US or Canadian ""user pays"" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as Britain, New Zealand or Australia.
The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.
Mexico City Unemployment Benefit Scheme – The only unemployment insurance system based on worker contributions exists in Mexico City.
Unemployed residents of Mexico City who are at least 18 years of age, have worked for at least six months, have no income, and are actively seeking work are eligible for unemployment benefits for up to six months, which are composed of payments of 30 days' worth of minimum wage per month.
Workers older than 50 years who are unemployed for over 2 months are entitled to a special benefit called the IOAW, if they do not receive the regular unemployment benefit (WW).
In New Zealand, Jobseeker Support, previously known as the Unemployment Benefit and also known as ""the dole"" provides income support for people who are looking for work or training for work.
In the Philippines, workers in the private sector who involuntarily became unemployed, including housemaids and Overseas Filipino Workers, are entitled to benefits through the Social Security Act of 2018.
For government workers, unemployment benefits are sourced from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).
In Poland, the system is designed to prevent people from living off unemployment benefits long term, thus forcing them to work or rely on non-state means of support (family, charities).
In comparison to the unemployment benefits paid by the state, as of January 2019, the minimum monthly pay is 2250,00 zł (US$595.51 in April 2019) before taxes.
Contributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months' contributions over a period of six years preceding unemployment.
In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the municipality tax rate).
By law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment.
Though policies vary by state, unemployment benefits generally pay eligible workers as high as US$1,015 in Massachusetts to a low as US$235 per week maximum in Mississippi.
Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct (""terminated for cause"") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those who quit or who are fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not.
Though the participation rate varies by state from below 10% to above 60%, nationwide only 29% of unemployed Americans (those seeking work) received unemployment benefits.
A survey of studies on unemployment insurance's effect on employment by the Political Economy Research Institute found that unemployed who collected benefits did not find themselves out of work longer than those who did not have unemployment benefits; and that unemployed workers did not search for work more or reduce their wage expectations once their benefits ran out.
One concern over unemployment insurance increasing unemployment is based on experience rating benefit uses which can sometimes be imperfect.
Possible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses.
International Labour Organization has adopted the Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988 for promotion of employment against unemployment and social security including unemployment benefit.

The S-D logic approach is changing the way that marketers understand value-creation and is changing concepts of the consumer's role in service delivery processes.
The American Marketing Association defines service marketing as an organizational function and a set of processes for identifying or creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in a way that benefit the organization and stake-holders.
In exchange for money, time, and effort, service customers expect value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities , networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.
The customer's interactions with a service provider typically involve face-to-face contact with service personnel, in addition to interactions with the physical elements of the service environment including the facilities and equipment.
Rented goods services: These services enable customers to obtain the temporary right to use a physical good that they prefer not to own (e.g. boats, costumes)
Variability (also known as heterogeneity) – services involve processes delivered by service personnel and subject to human variation, customers often seek highly customized solutions, services are inherently variable in quality and substance.
Another method used to classify services uses the degree of customer interaction in the service process and classifies services as high contact (e.g. hospitality, dental care, hairdressing) or low contact  (e.g. telecommunications, utility services).
These goods are called credence products because the consumer's quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.
The implication is that services tend to be high involvement decisions – where the consumer invests more heavily in information search activities during the purchase decision.
Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer's decision process, consumers of services are more likely to engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk.
Add to capacity – hire additional staff (e.g. casuals or temporary staff for peak periods); add to space (e.g. extra floor space in retail, hospitality or increased fleet size in transport services) Increasing capacity may require service re-design and presents a longer term solution to capacity problems.
Use Customers to Boost Productivity – Customers labour can be harnessed to reduce pressures on the system e.g. self-service, e-ticketing.
Ask Customers to use Third Parties – Where possible, have customers use agents or brokers to minimize the number of individual contacts and reduce pressure on the service system.
Shape demand- management may attempt to shape demand patterns through customer education programs or lobbying e.g. encourage engaged couples to hold wedding ceremonies on days other than Saturday spread demand more evenly across the days of the week, lobby different state authorities to stagger scheduled school holiday periods in order to spread demand for holiday services more evenly across the year.
Over-crowding and lengthy waiting lines potentially erode the customer experience and place stresses on employees and the service system.
Employees may compensate by minimizing the time spent with each customer in an effort to serve more people, but such responses have the potential to introduce human error into service delivery.
When demand exceeds capacity, customers may have to wait for services.
The argument that services require different marketing strategies is based on the insight that services are fundamentally different to goods and that services marketing requires different models to understand the marketing of services to customers.
At the Services Marketing Conference in 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of seven Ps, comprising the original four Ps plus process, people and physical evidence, as being more applicable for services marketing.
The model of 7 Ps has gained widespread acceptance, to the extent that some theorists have argued for the 7 Ps framework proposed by Booms and Bitner to be applied to products as a replacement for the four Ps. The extended marketing mix for services is more than the simple addition of three extra Ps. Rather it also modifies the traditional mix of product, price, place and promotion for superior application to services.
Timing of Payment: Given that customers are part of the service process and that some customers remain in the process for days, months or even years (e.g. guest house, hotel stay, university tuition), decisions must be made about whether to request payment at time when the service encounter is initiated, during the encounter or on termination of an encounter.
Contemporary service marketing texts tend to be organized around a framework of seven Ps or eight Ps. The 7 Ps comprises the original 4 Ps plus process, people, physical environment.
Therefore, service marketers must manage the physical evidence – which includes any element of the service environment which impacts on one or more of the customers five senses – the sense of smell, taste, hearing, sight and touch.
A number of different theoretical traditions can be used to inform the study of service environments including stimulus-organism-response (SOR) models; environmental psychology; semiotics and Servicescapes.
Dominance–submissiveness refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel in control and able to act freely within the service environment.
If the environment pleases, then the customer will be induced to stay longer and explore all that the service has to offer.
The longer a customer stays in an environment, the greater the opportunities to cross-sell a range of service offerings.
Signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service environment.
It refers to how customers utilize the space, during and after the service encounter.
In some services, such as clubs, bars and tours, the act of meeting other people and interacting with other customers forms an integral part of the service experience.
Elaborate servicescapes – environments that comprise multiple spaces, are rich in physical elements and symbolism, involve high contact services with many interactions between customers and employees.
According to the model's developer, the servicescape acts like a ""product's package"" – by communicating a total image to customers and providing information about how to use the service.
Service process
When customers enter a service firm they participate in a process.
In addition, customers interactions with both employees and other customers becomes part of the total service experience with obvious implications for service quality and productivity.
The customer's presence in the system means that the service process must be treated as a marketing issue.
In its simplest form, the service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer's perspective.
In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customization.
On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardizing each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design.
The people dimension refers to the human actors who are participants in the service encounter, namely employees and customers.
Service firms must manage interactions between customers and interactions between employees and customers.
Managing the behaviour of customers and employees in the service encounter is difficult.
In such an analogy, service personnel are the actors, customers are the audience; uniforms are costumes; the work setting is the stage (front-stage for areas where interaction occurs and back-stage for areas off limits to customers); discrete steps in the service process are scenes and finally the words and actions that occur represent the performance.
Within the services marketing literature, there are several different theoretical traditions that inform the understanding of service quality including the Nordic school, the Gaps model (also known as the American model and the performance only approach.
Service-dominant logic (SDL) is a new way of thinking about marketing, especially the goods versus services division and especially a fresh way of thinking about customer value and the value-creation process.
Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful.
Other research priorities include: the personalized customer experience, resource integration, improved use of IT to map processes and activities in order to increase productivity and standardize service.

Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,  and therefore should not be confused with offshoring which is relocating a business process to another country but does not imply or preclude another company.
In practice, the concepts can be intertwined, i.e. offshore outsourcing, and can be individually or jointly, partially or completely reversed, as described by terms such as reshoring, inshoring, and insourcing.
Cost savings from economies of scale and specialization can also motivate outsourcing, even if not offshoring.
To make this work, a new process was developed: ""outsource the outsourcing process"".
Details of managing DuPont's chief information officer Cinda Hallman's $4 billion 10-year outsourcing contract with Computer Sciences Corporation and Accenture were outsourced, thus avoiding ""inventing a process if we'd done it in-house"".
Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control by allowing organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them.

While U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce high top level executive or managerial costs, they primarily outsource to reduce peripheral and ""non-core"" business expenses.
IT-enabled services offshore outsourcing
The growth of offshoring of IT-enabled services, although not universally accepted, both to subsidiaries and to outside companies (offshore outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s.
In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or offshore outsourcing.
There are many outsourcing models, with variations by country, year and industry.
The global software R&D services market, as contrasted to information technology outsourcing (ITO) and business process outsourcing (BPO), is rather young and currently is at a relatively early stage of development.
Although many countries have participated in the offshore outsourcing of software development, their involvement in co-sourced and outsourced Research & Development (R&D) was somewhat limited.
A number of outsourcings and offshorings that were deemed failures led to reversals signaled by use of terms such as insourcing and reshoring.
Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the 2012 U.S. presidential campaigns, but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.
Insourcing is the process of reversing an outsourcing, possibly using help from those not currently part of the in-house staff.
Regional insourcing is a process in which a company establishes satellite locations for specific entities of their business, making use of advantages one state may have over another This concept focuses on the delegating or reassigning of procedures, functions, or jobs from production within a business in one location to another internal entity that specializes in that operation.
A 2004 study in the U.S., the UK, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced.
More than 90% of the jobs that American companies ""offshored"" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return.
For example, ""offshore insourcing"" is ""when companies set up their own ""captive"" process centers overseas, sometimes called a Captive Service, taking advantage of their cheaper surroundings while maintaining control of their back-office work and business processes."" ""Remote insourcing"" refers to hiring developers to work in-house from virtual (remote) facilities.
To defend against tax-motivated cost-shifting, the U.S. government passed regulations in 2006 to make outsourcing research harder.
""Outsourcing"" is a continuing political issue in the U.S., having been conflated with offshoring during the 2004 U.S. presidential election.
A Zogby International August 2004 poll found that 71% of American voters believed ""outsourcing jobs overseas"" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against these companies, possibly in the form of increased taxes.
Countries that have been the focus of outsourcing include India and the Philippines for American and European companies, and China and Vietnam for Japanese companies.
A China-based company, Lenovo, outsourced/reshored manufacturing of some time-critical customized PCs to the U.S. since ""If it made them in China they would spend six weeks on a ship.""
Business process outsourcing
Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a subset of outsourcing that involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of a specific business process to a third-party service provider.
Information technology-enabled service (ITES-BPO), knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) and legal process outsourcing (LPO), a.k.a. legal outsourcing, are some of the sub-segments of BPO.
Although BPO began as a cost-reducer, changes (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies now choose to outsource their back-office increasingly for time flexibility and direct quality control.
Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:
BPO vendor charges are project-based or fee-for-service, using business models such as remote in-sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models.
Supply chain management with effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing can increase the speed of several business processes.
BCM consists of a set of steps, to successfully identify, manage and control the business processes that are, or can be outsourced.
In 2015, official statistics put the size of the total outsourcing industry in China, including not only the BPO industry but also IT outsourcing services, at $130.9 billion.
Offshore outsourcing – combines outsourcing and offshoring; is the practice of hiring an external organization that is in another country to perform a business function.
Farmshoring – outsourcing to companies in more rural locations within the same country.

Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.
The funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final disposition.
In both a closed casket funeral and a memorial service, photos of the deceased representing stages of life would be displayed on an altar.
Funeral customs tend to be characterized by five ""anchors"": significant symbols, gathered community, ritual action, cultural heritage, and transition of the dead body (corpse).
Funerals in the Bahá'í Faith are characterized by not embalming, a prohibition against cremation, using a chrysolite or hardwood casket, wrapping the body in silk or cotton, burial not farther than an hour (including flights) from the place of death, and placing a ring on the deceased's finger stating, ""I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate."" The Bahá'í funeral service also contains the only prayer that is permitted to be read as a group – congregational prayer, although most of the prayer is read by one person in the gathering.
A Buddhist funeral marks the transition from one life to the next for the deceased.
Burial, rather than a destructive process such as cremation, was the traditional practice amongst Christians, because of the belief in the resurrection of the body.
Among Hindus, the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death.
The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south.
The belief that bodies are infested by Nasu upon death greatly influenced Zoroastrian burial ceremonies and funeral rites.
In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by salat (prayer).
Halakha calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the Hebrew Bible, and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers, and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave.
Funeral service, including eulogies and brief prayers.
Burial of the dead body in a grave.
Filling of the grave, traditionally done by family members and other participants at the funeral.
Próthesis is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funeral bed and the threnody of his relatives.
Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals.
The Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city (pomerium), for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.
Within the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts: visitation, funeral, and the burial service.
A home funeral (services prepared and conducted by the family, with little or no involvement from professionals) is legal in nearly every part of North America, but in the 21st century, they are uncommon in the US.
At the visitation (also called a ""viewing"", ""wake"" or ""calling hours""), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets).
The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial.
However, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed.
Funeral
The deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains.
The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cortège), with the hearse, funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held.
After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there.
If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium.
At a religious burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, tomb, mausoleum or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion.
Sometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the funeral to the burial site.
In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site.
In many religious traditions, pallbearers, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service.
In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells.
Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it.
Funerals for indigenous people, like many other cultures, are a method to remember, commemorate and respect the dead through their own cultural practices and traditions.
The service takes place after cremation or burial at sea, after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, or after the ashes have been scattered.
These services often take place at a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, school, workplace, church or other location of some significance.
While there is no visitation ceremony like in North America, relatives may view the body beforehand at the funeral home.
This allows the funeral to be held at a place without cremation or burial facilities.
The undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home, while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars.
Greek funerals are generally held in churches, including a Trisagion service.
The funeral usually takes place on the third day.
There are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony (ceremonia pogrzebowa, pogrzeb): the wake (czuwanie), then the body is carried by procession (usually on foot) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass, and another procession by foot to the gravesite.
The funeral where the priest blessed the recently deceased, which after the Reformation came to be called a reading, was forbidden in the church order of 1686, but was taken over by lay people instead.
The women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral, the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them.
A growing number of families choose to hold a life celebration or celebration of life event for the deceased in addition to or instead of a traditional funeral.
Such ceremonies may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship; restaurants, parks, pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased.
Originating in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., alongside the emergence of jazz music in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the jazz funeral is a traditionally African-American burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to New Orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music.
Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the ""main line"", who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow dirges and Christian hymns.
The institution works to officially certify burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries, making sure that appropriate materials are used.
Religiously, some adherents of the Roman Catholic Church often have particular interest in ""green"" funerals given the faith's preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in Catholic social teaching.
Actual events during non-religious funerals vary, but they frequently reflect upon the interests and personality of the deceased.
In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony.
Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as 85, in which case the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable.
In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body.
Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave.
Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal, cultural, and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death, bereavement, and the proper honoring, interment, and remembrance of the dead.
Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home, while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home.
The first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall.
In Mongolia, like many other cultures, funeral practices are the most important rituals that they follow[How so?].
Traditionally, attendants of a Vietnamese funeral service are encouraged to wear the color white.
For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased.
Ancient Chinese thought that the soul remains even after death, (immortal soul) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition.
Some people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family."

This shift was due to the rise of commercial television, which prompted film studio B movie production departments to transition into television film production divisions.
These divisions continued to create content similar to B movies, albeit in the form of low-budget films and series.
In post-Golden Age usage, B movies can encompass a wide spectrum of films, ranging from sensationalistic exploitation films to independent arthouse productions.
In either usage, most B movies represent a particular genre; the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s.
The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more lavishly budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.
As the average running time of top-of-the-line films increased, so did that of B pictures.
In its current usage, the term has somewhat contradictory connotations: it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is (a) a ""genre film"" with minimal artistic ambitions or (b) a lively, energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively serious independent film.
The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher-budget, mainstream films with exploitation-style content, usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movie.
These cheaper films (not yet called B movies) allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel.
The low-budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature, the B movie, of Hollywood's Golden Age.
The major studios, at first resistant to the double feature, soon adapted; all established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market.
Poverty Row studios, from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures, Tiffany Pictures, and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures, down to shoestring operations, made exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts, and also distributed totally independent productions and imported films.
To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as ""quickies"" for their tight production schedules—as short as four days.
As Azam Patel describes, ""Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily."" Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product.
Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, ""[t]he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got"", writes Epstein.
The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as ""programmers"" (also known as ""in-betweeners"" or ""intermediates"").
Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature releases in 1938, indicating the studios' relative emphasis on B production (United Artists produced little, focusing on the distribution of prestigious films from independent outfits; Grand National, active 1936–40, occupied an analogous niche on Poverty Row, releasing mostly independent productions):
Taves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies.
Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms, approximately 75% of Hollywood movies from the decade, more than four thousand pictures, are classifiable as Bs. The Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and, to a lesser degree, the 1940s.
Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that ""the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [Tom] Mix, [Ken] Maynard, and [Buck] Jones, the Columbia features with Buck Jones and Tim McCoy, the RKO George O'Brien series, the Republic Westerns with John Wayne and the Three Mesquiteers achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story."" At the far end of the industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out oaters starring Harry Carey, then in his fifties.
Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category, but even here there is ambiguity: at MGM, for example, popular series like the Andy Hardy and the Dr. Kildare–Dr. Gillespie chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at most of the lesser studios.
These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers.
The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir, Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), a 64-minute B, was produced at RKO, which released many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein.
The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling, offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films.
While the Golden Age-style second feature was dying, B movie was still used to refer to any low-budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers (sometimes referred to as B actors).
American International helped keep the original-release double bill alive through paired packages of its films: these movies were low-budget, but instead of a flat rate, they were rented out on a percentage basis, like A films.
At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.
Increasingly, American-made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired at low cost and, where necessary, dubbed for the U.S. market.
A suspense film, Terror Is a Man, ran as a ""co-feature"" with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: ""The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'"" That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: ""When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color."" The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification.
With the loosening of industry censorship constraints, the 1960s saw a major expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that became known collectively as exploitation films.
In the era of the traditional double feature, no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as ""B movies"".
With the majors having exited traditional B production and exploitation-style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the industry, ""exploitation"" became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films.
This new breed of gross-out movie typified the emerging sense of ""exploitation"", the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole.
That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade, with major consequences for the B movie.
An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue (1973), directed by James William Guercio.
The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement.
The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release.
As production of TV movies expanded with the introduction of the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory.
Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects.
The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low-budget film industry, as many B movies quickly wound up as ""filler"" material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose.
Of the nine films released that year to gross more than $100 million at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B-movie material before the late 1970s: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dick Tracy.
At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the ""sophisticated"" arthouse picture.
Director Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer (1979) and Ms. 45 (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: King of New York (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant (1992), $1.8 million, was financed totally independently.
Pulp Fiction (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino on an $8.5 million budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: ""With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect.""
The term Z movie (or grade-Z movie) is used by some to characterize low-budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even C movies.
It very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie."" The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon's such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, The Psychotronic Video Guide, and Psychotronic Video magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans."

Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects.
The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low-budget film industry, as many B movies quickly wound up as ""filler"" material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose.
Of the nine films released that year to gross more than $100 million at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B-movie material before the late 1970s: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dick Tracy.
At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the ""sophisticated"" arthouse picture.
Director Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer (1979) and Ms. 45 (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: King of New York (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant (1992), $1.8 million, was financed totally independently.
Pulp Fiction (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino on an $8.5 million budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: ""With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect.""
The term Z movie (or grade-Z movie) is used by some to characterize low-budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even C movies.
It very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie."" The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon's such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, The Psychotronic Video Guide, and Psychotronic Video magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans."

rather,"Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .",['d000.s103.t006'],['rather%4:02:02::'],['Definition not found.'],"In common usage, particularly in English language teaching, particular tense–aspect–mood combinations such as ""present progressive"" and ""conditional perfect"" are often referred to simply as ""tenses"".
Verb tenses are inflectional forms which can be used to express that something occurs in the past, present, or future.
However the same forms are quite often also used to refer to future circumstances, as in ""He's coming tomorrow"" (hence this tense is sometimes referred to as present-future or non-past).
For certain grammatical contexts where the present tense is the standard way to refer to the future, see conditional sentences and dependent clauses below.
In a present indicative construction, the finite verb appears in its base form, or in its -s form if its subject is third-person singular.
For specific uses of present tense constructions, see the sections below on simple present, present progressive, present perfect, and present perfect progressive.
Past tense forms express circumstances existing at some time in the past, although they also have certain uses in referring to hypothetical situations (as in some conditional sentences, dependent clauses and expressions of wish).
Certain uses of the past tense may be referred to as subjunctives; however the only distinction in verb conjugation between the past indicative and past subjunctive is the possible use of were in the subjunctive in place of was.
For specific uses of past tense constructions, see the sections below on simple past, past progressive, past perfect, and past perfect progressive.
English lacks a morphological future tense, since there is no verb inflection which expresses that an event will occur at a future time.
For specific uses of future constructions formed with will/shall, see the sections below on simple future, future progressive, future perfect, and future perfect progressive.
The morphological present tense can be used to refer to future times, particularly in conditional sentences and dependent clauses.
""Simple"" forms of verbs are those appearing in constructions not marked for either progressive or perfect aspect (I go, I don't go, I went, I will go, etc., but not I'm going or I have gone).
They may also denote a temporary state (imperfective aspect), in the case of stative verbs that do not use progressive forms (see below).
For uses of specific simple constructions, see the sections below on simple present, simple past, simple future, and simple conditional.
It is expressed using the auxiliary verb to be together with the present participle (-ing form) of the main verb: I am reading; Were you shouting?; He will be sitting over there.
Their non-progressive forms (simple or non-progressive perfect constructions) are used in many situations even when expressing a temporary state.
The verb to have does not use progressive forms when it expresses possession, broadly understood (I have a brother, not *I'm having a brother), but it does use them in its active meanings (I'm having a party; She's having a baby; He was having a problem starting his car).
Other verbs expressing a state of possession or similar, such as possess, own, belong and owe, also do not normally use progressive forms.
For specific uses of progressive (continuous) constructions, see the sections below on present progressive, past progressive, future progressive, and conditional progressive.
It is expressed using a form of the auxiliary verb have (appropriately conjugated for tense etc.) together with the past participle of the main verb: She has eaten it; We had left; When will you have finished?
The implications of the present perfect (that something occurred prior to the present moment) are similar to those of the simple past, although the two forms are generally not used interchangeably—the simple past is used when the time frame of reference is in the past, while the present perfect is used when it extends to the present.
For all uses of specific perfect constructions, see the sections below on the present perfect, past perfect, future perfect, and conditional perfect.
By using non-finite forms of the auxiliary have, perfect aspect can also be marked on infinitives (as in should have left and expect to have finished working), and on participles and gerunds (as in having seen the doctor).
Although all of the constructions referred to here are commonly referred to as perfect (based on their grammatical form), some of them, particularly non-present and non-finite instances, might not be considered truly expressive of the perfect aspect.
This applies particularly when the perfect infinitive is used together with modal verbs: for example, he could not have been a genius might be considered (based on its meaning) to be a past tense of he cannot/could not be a genius; such forms are considered true perfect forms by some linguists but not others.
Here a form of the verb have (denoting the perfect) is used together with been (the past participle of be, denoting the progressive) and the present participle of the main verb.
In the case of the stative verbs, which do not use progressive aspect (see the section above about the progressive), the plain perfect form is normally used in place of the perfect progressive: I've been here for half an hour (not *I've been being here...).
For uses of specific perfect progressive (perfect continuous) constructions, see the sections below on the present perfect progressive, past perfect progressive, future perfect progressive, and conditional perfect progressive.
The English conditional is expressed periphrastically with verb forms governed by the auxiliary verb would (or sometimes should with a first-person singular subject; see shall and will).
For uses of specific conditional constructions, see the sections below on simple conditional, conditional progressive, conditional perfect, and conditional perfect progressive, as well as the section on conditional sentences (and the main article on English conditional sentences).
Passive voice can be expressed in combination together with tenses, aspects and moods, by means of appropriate marking of the auxiliary (which for this purpose is not a stative verb, i.e. it has progressive forms available).
The passive forms of certain of the combinations involving the progressive aspect are quite rare; these include the present perfect progressive (it has been being written), past perfect progressive (it had been being written), future progressive (it will be being written), future perfect progressive (it will have been being written), conditional progressive (it would be being written) and conditional perfect progressive (it would have been being written).
The simple past or past simple, sometimes also called the preterite, consists of the bare past tense of the verb (ending in -ed for regular verbs, and formed in various ways for irregular ones, with the following spelling rules for regular verbs: verbs ending in -e add only –d to the end (e.g. live – lived, not *liveed), verbs ending in -y change to -ied (e.g. study – studied) and verbs ending in a group of a consonant + a vowel + a consonant double the final consonant (e.g. stop – stopped) —see English verbs for details).
The past simple is also used without past reference in some instances: in condition clauses and some other dependent clauses referring to hypothetical circumstances (see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and § Dependent clauses below), and after certain expressions of wish.
The past progressive or past continuous construction combines progressive aspect with past tense, and is formed using the past tense of be (was or were) with the present participle of the main verb.
For stative verbs that do not use the progressive aspect, the simple past is used instead (At three o'clock yesterday we were in the garden).
The past progressive shares certain special uses with other past tense constructions; see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing, § Dependent clauses, {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing, and § Indirect speech.
The past perfect, sometimes called the pluperfect, combines past tense with perfect aspect; it is formed by combining had (the past tense of the auxiliary have) with the past participle of the main verb.
For example, while it is incorrect to say *I have done it last Friday (the use of last Friday, specifying the past time, would require the simple past rather than the present perfect), there is no such objection to a sentence like ""I had done it the previous Friday"".
However, if the state is temporary and the verb can be used in the progressive aspect, the past perfect progressive would normally be used instead.
It is formed by combining had (the past tense of auxiliary have), been (the past participle of be), and the present participle of the main verb.
Uses of the past perfect progressive are analogous to those of the present perfect progressive, except that the point of reference is in the past.
If the verb in question does not use the progressive aspect, then the plain past perfect is used instead (see examples in the previous section).
The past perfect progressive may also have additional specific uses similar to those of the plain past perfect; see § Conditional sentences, § Dependent clauses, § Expressions of wish, and § Indirect speech.
The simple present or present simple is a form that combines present tense with ""simple"" (neither perfect nor progressive) aspect.
With stative verbs in senses that do not use progressive aspect, to refer to a present or general state, whether temporary, permanent or habitual.
It consists of a form of the simple present of be together with the present participle of the main verb and the ending -ing.
Certain stative verbs do not use the progressive aspect, so the present simple is used instead in those cases (see § Progressive aspect above).
The present perfect (traditionally called simply the perfect) combines present tense with perfect aspect, denoting the present state of an action's being completed, that is, that the action took place before the present time.
(It is thus often close in meaning to the simple past tense, although the two are not usually interchangeable.) It is formed with the present tense of the auxiliary have (namely have or has) and the past participle of the main verb.
The choice of present perfect or past tense depends on the frame of reference (period or point in time) in which the event is conceived as occurring.
It is therefore normally incorrect to write a sentence like *I have written a novel yesterday; the present perfect cannot be used with an expression of past time such as yesterday.
When the circumstance is temporary, the present perfect progressive is often appropriate in such sentences (see below); however, if the verb is one that does not use the progressive aspect, the basic present perfect is used in that case too:
It is formed with the present tense of have (have or has), the past participle of be (been), and the present participle of the main verb and the ending -ing.
(A sentence without perfect aspect, such as I am sitting here for three hours, implies an intention to perform the action for that length of time.) With stative verbs that are not used in the progressive, and for situations that are considered permanent, the present perfect (non-progressive) is used instead; for examples of this see § Present perfect above.
The term simple future, future simple or future indefinite, as applied to English, generally refers to the combination of the modal auxiliary verb will with the bare infinitive of the main verb.
Use of present tense rather than future constructions in condition clauses and certain other dependent clauses is described below under {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and § Dependent clauses.
The modal verbs will and shall also have other uses besides indicating future time reference.
The future progressive or future continuous combines progressive aspect with future time reference; it is formed with the auxiliary will (or shall in the first person; see shall and will), the bare infinitive be, and the present participle of the main verb.
The usual restrictions apply, on the use both of the future and of the progressive: simple rather than progressive aspect is used with some stative verbs (see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing), and present rather than future constructions are used in many dependent clauses (see § Conditional sentences and § Dependent clauses below).
For the use of the present tense rather than future constructions in certain dependent clauses, see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and § Dependent clauses below.
It is formed by combining the auxiliary will (or sometimes shall, as above), the bare infinitive have, the past participle been, and the present participle of the main verb.
Uses of the future perfect progressive are analogous to those of the present perfect progressive, except that the point of reference is in the future.
For the use of present tense in place of future constructions in certain dependent clauses, see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and § Dependent clauses below.
The simple conditional or conditional simple, also called conditional present, and in some meanings future-in-the-past simple, is formed by combining the modal auxiliary would with the bare infinitive of the main verb.
(This is described in more detail in the article on English conditional sentences; see also § Conditional sentences below.) The time referred to may be (hypothetical) present or future.
The conditional perfect construction combines conditional mood with perfect aspect, and consists of would (or the contraction 'd, or sometimes should in the first person, as above), the bare infinitive have, and the past participle of the main verb.
It consists of would (or sometimes should in the first person, as above) with the bare infinitive have, the past participle been and the present participle of the main verb.
In colloquial English, particularly British English, the present perfect of the verb get, namely have got or has got, is frequently used in place of the simple present indicative of have (i.e. have or has) when denoting possession, broadly defined.
Another common idiom is the use of the modal verb can (or could for the past tense or conditional) together with verbs of perception such as see, hear, etc., rather than the plain verb.
It uses the present tense (with future reference) in the condition clause, and the future with will (or some other expression of future) in the main clause:
It uses the past tense (with the past subjunctive were optionally replacing was) in the condition clause, and the conditional formed with would in the main clause:
Particular rules apply to the tenses and verb forms used after the verb wish and certain other expressions with similar meaning.
When the verb wish governs a finite clause, the past tense (simple past or past progressive as appropriate) is used when the desire expressed concerns a present state, the past perfect (or past perfect progressive) when it concerns a (usually counterfactual) past state or event, and the simple conditional with would when it concerns a desired present action or change of state.
This change does not normally apply, however, when the past tense is used to denote an unreal rather than a past circumstance (see expressions of wish, conditional sentences and dependent clauses):
The tense changes above do not apply when the verb of saying (etc.) is not past or conditional in form; in particular there are no such changes when that verb is in the present perfect: He has said that he likes apples.
Apart from the special cases referred to in the sections above, many other dependent clauses use a tense that might not logically be expected – in particular the present tense is used when the reference is to future time, and the past tense is used when the reference is to a hypothetical situation (in other words, the form with will is replaced by the present tense, and the form with would by the past tense).
The use of present and past tenses without reference to present and past time does not apply to all dependent clauses, however; if the future time or hypothetical reference is expressed in the dependent clause independently of the main clause, then a form with will or would in a dependent clause is possible:
The main uses of the various nonfinite verb forms (infinitives, participles and gerunds) are described in the following sections.
The present participle is one of the uses of the -ing form of a verb.
For present participle constructions with perfect aspect (e.g. having written), see § Perfect and progressive nonfinite constructions below.
An English irregular verb’s simple past tense form is typically distinct from its past participle (with which the auxiliary to have constructs the past perfect), as in went vs.
However, not all irregular verbs distinguish them from each other and their unmarked form (with which the particle to constructs the full infinitive, as in to go): the participle may use the simple past form as in to say, said, have said, or use the unmarked form as in to come, came, have come.
For verbs with three distinct such forms in standardized Englishes (go/went/gone), many speakers use the same form for the past tense and past participle.
With a few verbs (such as to see, to do, to ring and to be), the standardized past participle form is used for the simple past, as in ""I seen it yesterday"" vs.
(perfect infinitive; for similar constructions and their meanings see English modal verbs)
Besides its nonfinite verbal uses as a gerund or present participle, the -ing form of a verb is also used as a deverbal noun, denoting an activity or occurrence in general, or a specific action or event (or sometimes a more distant meaning, such as building or piping denoting an object or system of objects)."

It was the first competition between the Soviet national team and a Canadian team represented by professional players of the National Hockey League (NHL), known as Team Canada.
The Soviets had become the dominant team in international competitions, in which the Canadian professionals were ineligible to play.
The first four games of the series were held in Canada and the final four in Moscow.
The Soviet Union surprised the Canadian team and most of the Canadian hockey media with an opening game victory, 7–3.
The final game was won in dramatic fashion, with the Canadians overcoming a two-goal Soviet lead after two periods.
The series was played during the Cold War, and intense feelings of nationalism were aroused in fans in both Canada and the Soviet Union and players on the ice.
The games introduced several talented Soviet players to North America, such as Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Alexander Yakushev, Valeri Kharlamov and goaltender Vladislav Tretiak.
Team Canada, the first NHL and professional all-star team formed for international play, was led by Phil Esposito, who led the series in scoring, as well as contributing in other roles.
The Canadian line of Bobby Clarke, Ron Ellis and Henderson, which was not expected to start for the team, as none were yet stars, played a surprisingly large role in the Canadian victory, with Henderson scoring the game-winning goal in each of the final three games.
The series was filled with controversy, including disputes over officiating, and dirty play on the part of both teams highlighted by the deliberate slash of Kharlamov by Clarke in game six.
There was also the exclusion of top Canadian player Bobby Hull, the second leading goalscorer in the NHL the previous season and who had led the league in goalscoring seven times, because he had signed a contract to play in the new World Hockey Association (WHA).
From the beginning of the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships in 1920, Canada would send a senior amateur club team, usually the previous year's Allan Cup champion, to compete as the Canadian entry.
In the earliest days of the Soviet Union, bandy or ""Russian hockey"" was played, not ""Canadian hockey"", and the Soviets did not compete in the Olympics or World Championships for ice hockey, which played the Canadian game.
Starting in the 1940s, the Soviet Union started a Soviet hockey league playing the Canadian game.
The Soviets divulged that they were ready to play in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals.
The two sides agreed on the terms: four games in Canada in early September, and four games later in the month in the Soviet Union.
He also announced that Team Canada hoped to play a game or two in Czechoslovakia in return for previous visits by Czechoslovakian teams to Canada.
The Canadians agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series, and European referees in the Moscow games.
The agreement stipulated that Soviet players were to be paid CA$5,000 per game in Canada, and Canadian players were to be paid 5,000 Rbls per game in Moscow.
NHL players' union president and Hockey Canada director Alan Eagleson, while not involved in the initial negotiations, became a central figure in the organization of the series.
Eagleson, who could call on a personal network of players, NHL owners, Hockey Canada executives and Canadian business, would be involved in most arrangements for the Canadian team.
Bobrov was a former player who had played against Canada in the 1950s and later managed the Soviet national soccer team and the Moscow Spartak ice hockey team.
Bobrov had been given the job as the Soviets' national ice hockey team coach, replacing long-time coach Anatoly Tarasov after the 1972 Winter Olympics.
Bobby Orr, who had been selected although he was injured, remained with the team during the series and practiced with them, but did not play in any games.
While the Soviet team was in Canada, Rick Noonan, a trainer for the University of British Columbia’s sports teams, was assigned by Hockey Canada to assist the Soviets.
Noonan, who would be later be named general manager of Team Canada for the 1980 Winter Olympics, was the only Canadian to have regular access to the Soviets' locker room, and he was behind the Soviets' bench during the first four games of the Summit Series.
The Soviets were not expected to even give the Canadians a challenge, and Canada was going into this series expected to win handily.
Sinden opined, ""Canada is first in the world in two things: hockey and wheat."" Alan Eagleson said, ""We gotta win in eight games.
In a game scouted by Team Canada, Tretiak had given up eight goals in a game played the day before his wedding.
He blamed the NHL: ""This, the most important hockey event of our time, has been tacked onto the front of the NHL season as something only tolerated by the owners, and endorsed by the players as a means of enriching their pension plan."" Former professional player Billy Harris who had coached Sweden's national team earlier in the year, predicted a Soviets' win, largely on the strength of Tretiak's goaltending.
Former Canadian national team coach David Bauer also warned about the quality of the Soviets skating and their team play.
Canada was assigned the home team for all games in Canada, while the Soviets would be the home team in Moscow.
Henderson scored after six minutes to give Canada a two-goal lead on a faceoff win by Clarke (the only advantage that Team Canada had, in Sinden's estimation).
According to Sinden, the Canadian players had lost their poise, ""running all over the ice"" trying to establish their hitting game, while the Soviets used an unexpected tactic, the long pass, to break a man out of their defensive zone.
In the Canadians' attempt to tie the game, Yvan Cournoyer put a puck off the post, but the Soviets broke out afterwards and Boris Mikhailov scored on the counterattack to restore their two-goal lead with six minutes to play.
Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once."" At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.
Team Canada responded to their previous defeat with stronger play in this game.
In the second period, Esposito again scored the first goal of the game, this time from a feed from his regular Boston Bruins' linemate Cashman, who had retrieved the puck deep in the Soviets' zone after colliding with USSR defenceman Vladimir Lutchenko.
Team Canada's 4–1 win tied the series at one game apiece.
Team Canada agreed to the Soviets' request to change referees, apparently not aware of Starovoitov's tantrum after game two.
After the second game, the Soviets said that they had strayed into playing too much of the Canadian style, as individuals, and promised to return to their team style for the third game.
Team Canada held leads of 3–1 and 4–2, but the Soviets rallied and the game ended in a 4–4 tie.
After a strong forecheck by the Canadians in the Soviets' zone, Ratelle scored off a turnover to put Canada ahead 2–1 after the first.
But on another Canadian power play, Kharlamov circled behind the Canadian defence and gathered a breakaway pass, then beat Tony Esposito to score the Soviets' second shorthanded goal.
The game started with two consecutive penalties by Bill Goldsworthy, and Boris Mikhailov converted both into power play goals to give the Soviets a 2–0 lead.
Team Canada was booed off the ice at the end of what was the final game of the series played in Canada.
Responding to the negative public and media reaction in light of the expectation for an overwhelming Team Canada sweep of the series, Phil Esposito made an emotional outburst in a post-game interview:
Team Canada arrived in Moscow for the final four games at the Luzhniki Ice Palace, accompanied by 3,000 Canadian fans.
Not long after starting practices in Moscow, Team Canada players Vic Hadfield, Rick Martin and Jocelyn Guevremont left the team and went home for what they felt was a lack of playing time.
The cheering of the Canadian fans was unknown at Soviet hockey games.
Team Canada was now faced with the daunting task of having to win all three remaining games to win the series.
According to Montreal Gazette sports editor Ted Blackman, Canadian players Ken Dryden and Brad Park turned in their first big games of the series.
Dryden ended a personal losing streak to Soviet teams dating back to his amateur career and two previous games in the series.
According to commentator Brian Conacher, Team Canada had adjusted its game to not play ""dump and chase"" but instead retain possession in the offensive zone.
According to Conacher, ""for the first time, the Soviets had opened the door a crack and Team Canada had rushed through like a freight train.""
Following the game, the Canadians complained that Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader, the German referees (the same who refereed a controversial Canada-Sweden game), were biased, since Canada was assessed 31 minutes in penalties while the Soviets received only four minutes.
During game six, Valeri Kharlamov was targeted by Team Canada for attention.
In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that ""from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle."" He noted ""that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice."" Media opinion is divided on the effect it had on the outcome of the series.
Kharlamov, who had been one of the Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score.
Team Canada won game seven by a 4–3 score to even the series 3-3-1.
Eagleson threatened to pull Team Canada from playing the eighth game.
The pre-game presentation was cancelled by the Soviets, but restored on the insistence of Team Canada.
Heading into the eighth and final game, each team had three wins, three losses and one tie, but the Soviets were two goals ahead in goal differential.
After Parisé's penalty was served, it was Canada's turn to go on the power play, and Esposito scored his sixth goal of the series to tie it at 1–1.
The teams exchanged power plays before Lutchenko scored a power-play goal on a slap shot to put the Soviets ahead 2–1.
The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series followed by Valery Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods.
Canada held on to win the game and the series, four games to three with one tie.
Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series.
After the series, it was reported that NHL president Campbell and Chicago Black Hawks' owner Bill Wirtz had concluded an agreement with the Soviets for the Soviet national team to play an exhibition series in January 1973 against the Boston Bruins, New York Rangers and Chicago Black Hawks.
Bobby Hull also criticized Team Canada, stating that the fighting and gestures of the Canadian players ""were a bad example to young players and diplomatically harmful"".
They did compliment Team Canada on their defensive skills, but felt that the Soviets were technically superior, and, but for some deplorable mistakes by their players, the Soviets would have won the series.
Other Team Canada games
During the two-week hiatus between games four and five, the Canadians visited Sweden and played two exhibition games versus the Sweden national team.
These two referees would figure prominently in games six and eight of the Canada-Soviet Union series.
Team Canada was heavily criticized by the Swedish media for its ""criminal""-style play during the two games.
The time in Sweden helped bring Team Canada together as a team and focused them for the final four games.
After the series, Team Canada played an exhibition game against the Czechoslovak national team; at the time, the world champions.
The games' broadcasts were produced by Hockey Canada, using experienced hockey commentators from Canadian television networks.
In French, all games were broadcast on TV Radio-Canada and the broadcast team was Rene Lecavalier and former player Jacques Plante for the games played in Canada, and with SRC's Richard Garneau for the games played in Moscow - Garneau was already in Europe, having covered the 1972 Summer Olympics.
While Canada won the series, the Soviets earned the respect of fans and players alike.
According to IIHF historians, Szemberg and Podnieks, the Summit Series convinced Canadians that ice hockey was now a global game and that any one of the top national teams in the world could win the Olympic or World Championship titles.
Eleven of the Soviet 1972 team players played against the Montreal Canadiens in the December 31, 1975, game of the Super Series '76.
Seven players of Team Canada 1972 played for Montreal (Frank Mahovlich, Pete Mahovlich, Awrey, Cournoyer, Dryden, Lapointe and Savard).
Many of the players also played in the 1976 Canada Cup, including Bobby Orr, making his first appearance against the Soviets as a professional.

Authorities most commonly use prisons within a criminal-justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those who have pled or been found guilty of crimes at trial may be  sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.
A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government.
Outside of the United States, prison and jail often have the same meaning.
In New Zealand, the terms ""jail"" and ""prison"" are commonly used, although the terms ""correctional facility"" and ""prison"" among others are in official usage.
Officially, the term ""correctional centre"" is used for almost all prisons in New South Wales and Queensland, while other states and territories use a variety of names.
In Canada, while the terms ""jail"" and ""prison"" are commonly used in speech, officially named facilities use ""facility"", ""correctional centre"", ""penitentiary"", or ""institution"".
The use of prisons can be traced back to the rise of the state as a form of social organization.
In these facilities the inmates were given ""prison labor"" jobs that were anticipated to shape them into hardworking individuals and prepare them for the real world.
By the end of the 17th century, houses of correction were absorbed into local prison facilities under the control of the local justice of the peace.
It was the first facility to make any medical services available to prisoners.
The turn of the 19th century would see the first movement toward prison reform, and by the 1810s, the first state prisons and correctional facilities were built, thereby inaugurating the modern prison facilities available today.
Prison reform movement
He proposed wide-ranging reforms to the system, including the housing of each prisoner in a separate cell and the requirements that staff should be professional and paid by the government, that outside inspection of prisons should be imposed, and that prisoners should be provided with a healthy diet and reasonable living conditions.
Development of the modern prison
The notion of prisoners being incarcerated as part of their punishment and not simply as a holding state until trial or hanging, was at the time revolutionary.
The first state prison in England was the Millbank Prison, established in 1816 with a capacity for just under 1,000 inmates.
By the 1840s, penal transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was on the decline, and the Surveyor-General of convict prisons, Joshua Jebb, set an ambitious program of prison building in the country, with one large prison opening per year.
Pentonville prison opened in 1842, beginning a trend of ever increasing incarceration rates and the use of prison as the primary form of crime punishment.
The use of prisons in Continental Europe was never as popular as it became in the English-speaking world, although state prison systems were largely in place by the end of the 19th century in most European countries.
Prisons employ people to run and maintain the prison while keeping control of the inmates.
(In comparison, 19th-century prisons had large landings and cell blocks which permitted only intermittent observation of prisoners.) Smaller, separate and self-contained housing units known as ""pods"" or ""modules"" are designed to hold 16 to 50 prisoners and are arranged around exercise yards or support facilities in a decentralized ""campus"" pattern.
Some modern prisons may exclude certain inmates from the general population, usually for safety reasons, such as those within solitary confinement, celebrities, political figures and former law enforcement officers, those convicted of sexual crimes and/or crimes against children, or those on the medical wing or protective custody.
Modern prisons often hold hundreds or thousands of inmates, and must have facilities onsite to meet most of their needs, including dietary, health, fitness, education, religious practices, entertainment, and many others.
Additionally, prison medical staff play a major role in monitoring, organizing, and controlling the prison population through the use of psychiatric evaluations and interventions (psychiatric drugs, isolation in mental health units, etc.).
This leads to a high demand for medical services, and in countries such as the US that do not provide tax-payer funded healthcare, prison is often the first place that people are able to receive medical treatment (which they could not afford outside).
Some prison medical facilities include primary care, mental health services, dental care, substance abuse treatment, and other forms of specialized care, depending on the needs of the inmate population and the willingness of the prison to provide for these needs.
Some prisons provide educational programs for inmates that can include basic literacy, secondary education, or even college education.
Under the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the United States, all prison institutions offer literacy programs to expand inmates' educational opportunities.
A control unit or segregation unit (also called a ""block"" or ""isolation cell"") is a highly secure area of the prison, where inmates are placed in solitary confinement to isolate them from the general population.
Prisons for juveniles are known by a variety of names, including ""youth detention facilities"", ""juvenile detention centers"", and ""reformatories"".
It was estimated that in 2011 more than 95,000 juveniles were locked up in prisons and jails in the United States (the largest youth prisoner population in the world).
Women's prisons
Military prisons in the United States have also been converted to civilian prisons, to include Alcatraz Island.
The United States government refers to psychiatric prisons housing federal inmates as ""Federal Medical Centers (FMC)"".
Prison population
In 2021, the United States of America had the world's largest prison population, with over 2 million people in American prisons or jails—up from 744,000 in 1985—making 1 in every 200 American adults a prisoner.
In the United States alone, more than $74 billion per year is spent on prisons, with over 800,000 people employed in the prison industry.
As the prison population grows, revenues increase for a variety of small and large businesses that construct facilities, and provide equipment (security systems, furniture, clothing), and services (transportation, communications, healthcare, food) for prisons.
Some scholars, using the term prison-industrial complex, have argued that the trend of ""hiring out prisoners"" is a continuation of the slavery tradition, pointing out that the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution freed slaves but allowed forced labor for people convicted of crimes.
A 2014 US report found that this included 64% of local jail inmates, 54% of state prisoners and 45% of federal prisoners.
The social system within the prison commonly develops an ""inmate code"", an informal set of internal values and rules that govern prison life and relationships, but that may be at odds with the interests of prison management or external society, compromising future rehabilitation and increasing recidivism rates.
In the United States and Canada, prison agencies are often referred to as ""Corrections"" services for this reason.
On the other hand, in many countries including the United States, the vast majority of prisoners are rearrested within 3 years of their release.
Prison reform organizations such as the Howard League for Penal Reform are not entirely opposed to attempting to rehabilitate offenders, but instead argue that most prisoners would be more likely to be rehabilitated if they received a punishment other than prison.
Prison reformers also argue that alternative methods are often better at rehabilitating offenders and preventing crime in the long term.
Alternatives to prison sentences include:
The movement is associated with libertarian socialism, anarchism and anti-authoritarianism, with some prison abolitionists arguing that imprisoning people for actions the state designates as crimes is not only inexpedient but also immoral.
