4 ball 
5 ball 
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining five object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 6.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining six object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 7.
(Pocketing the 8 early is a loss of game—unless done on the break shot, in most rules variants.) In other games, such as nine-ball and straight pool, the 8 is simply another object ball.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining eight object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 9.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining nine object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 10, and the 10 ball and pocket are called.
Used in snooker in reference to the position of the cue ball.
In snooker and pool, a cue ball situated in the jaws of a pocket such that a/the ball-on cannot be struck directly.
The ball placed at the front of a group of racked object balls (i.e., toward the breaker and furthest from the racker), and in most games situated over the table's foot spot.
In carom games, a shot in which in attempting to score, the cue ball contacts three or more cushions, usually including both short rails.
Used in snooker to describe the path that the cue ball must take into and out of baulk as a result of poor position play, specifically coming around the baulk colours off three or more cushions, normally on a shot on the blue to finish on a red as a result of finishing low on the blue.
A cut shot in which if a line were drawn from the cue ball to the rail behind the targeted object ball, perpendicular to that rail, the object ball would lie beyond the line with respect to the pocket being targeted.
This balk is where the cue ball is placed in lagging for lead, for making the opening break shot, and sometimes for other purposes, depending upon the game.
In the eponymous balkline billiards there are four balklines, drawn parallel to and typically 14 or 18 inches from the cushions of the table, dividing it into nine compartments or divisions, of which the outside eight are the balks, in which only a set number of caroms may be scored before at least one ball must leave the area.
The option of placing the cue ball anywhere on the table prior to shooting, in a game of pool.
A common variation, used in games such as straight pool and often in bar pool, is ball-in-hand ""behind the head string"", also ""behind the line"" or ""from the kitchen"", meaning the ball-in-hand option is restricted to placement anywhere behind the head string, i.e., in the area of the table known as the kitchen.
Coin-operated bar tables have ball-return mechanisms that separate the cue ball from the object balls so that the object balls are captured when pocketed until the game ends, then released when paid for again, while the cue ball is continually returned for continued play after scratches.
There are tables that use optical sensors to distinguish a standard cue ball from object balls.
Some of them are also setup to return the 8 ball as well, so that pocketing it on the break does not end the game.
Shot in which an object ball is driven to one or more rails prior to being pocketed (or in some contexts, prior to reaching its intended target; not necessarily a pocket).
A rule variant common in bar pool versions of eight-ball, in which the 8-ball must be pocketed on a bank shot (generally this would either be accomplished via a bank shot proper or a kick shot); shooting the 8 straight in is a loss of game.
Pool, almost always a variant of eight-ball, that is played by bar players on a bar table.
Typical differences between bar pool and tournament eight-ball are the lack of ball-in-hand after a foul, the elimination of a number of fouls, and (with numbered ball sets) the requirement that most aspects of a shot be called (including cushions and other object balls to be contacted) not just the target ball and pocket.
Another distinguishing factor is the cue ball; these tables capture pocketed object balls to remove them from play, but selectively return a scratched cue ball.
Used in snooker in reference to the position of the cue ball.
A pool and occasionally snooker term (inherited from carom billiards by way of ""big ball"", above), it is a metaphor for a shot that is very difficult to miss pocketing for any of a number of reasons, most commonly: either the object ball is positioned such that a near miss on one side of it will likely cause the cue ball to rebound off the rail into the object ball and pocket it anyway; or another ball is positioned such that if the target ball does not go straight in, it is still likely to go in off the other ball in a kiss.
1.  Any shot in which the cue ball is caromed off an object ball to strike another object ball (with or without contacting cushions in the interim).
2.  In certain carom billiards games such as three-cushion, a successful attempt at making a scoring billiard shot under the rules for that game (such as contacting three cushions with the cue ball while executing the billiard).
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the black ball is placed.
1.  In snooker, the colour ball worth five points, placed on the blue spot in the centre of the table.
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the blue ball is placed.
The bottle used in various games to hold numbered peas, it is employed to assign random spots to players in a roster (such as in a tournament), or to assign random balls to players of a game (such as in kelly pool and bottle pool).
In carom games it describes the first point attempt, as shot from an unvarying cue ball and object balls placement; in many pool games it describes the first shot, which is used to separate the object balls that have been racked together;
Chiefly American: In pool games, when a player breaks the racked object balls, pockets at least one ball on the break, and commences to run out the remaining object balls without the opponent getting a visit at the table.
In straight pool, the last object ball left on a table before the remaining fourteen balls must be racked so the player at the table may continue their run.
It is called the ""break ball"" because it is common for players to try to leave this ball in such a position that they may easily pot it and billiard off of it to break open the rack of fourteen balls and continue their run.
In European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF) nine-ball, the break box is a zone in the ""kitchen"" of the head (British: bottom) of the table, from which the break shot must be taken with the cue ball.
This departure from WPA World Standardised Rules defeats the common break-from-the-side-rail technique for pocketing the 9 ball to win the game on the break; while 9 ball breaks are still possible, they are much more difficult under this rule.
The spot (often not marked) on a snooker table at which the brown ball is placed.
For example, in straight pool a player must call the pocket in which a ball is intended to be potted.
Applies specifically to games that enforce ""call-pocket/call-safe"" rules, which require the player to either call the ball and pocket, or call a safety on every shot.
After a legal shot, where a called ball is not pocketed as designated, the incoming player has the option to pass the shot back to the player who missed the called shot.
A call-shot/call-safe nine-ball example: Player A calls the ball-on, the 3 ball in this case, in the corner pocket but misses the shot.
The cue ball rolls down table and comes to rest behind the 5 ball leaving no clear path to the 3 ball for the incoming player B.
Describes any game in which during normal play a player must call the ball to be hit and the intended pocket; ""eight-ball is a call-shot game."" Sometimes referred to as ""call[ed]-pocket"", ""ball-and-pocket rules"", etc., to distinguish it from the common North American bar pool practice of requiring every aspect of shots to be called, such as caroms, kicks, and cushions to be contacted (this is sometimes also ambiguously referred to as ""call-shot"", but more accurately termed ""call-everything"" or ""call-it-all"").
Commonly in bar rules terminology, call-shot indicates how the shot will be made as compared to call-pocket which means simply that the ball must go into that pocket, details unnecessary.
The ball designated by a player to be pocketed on a shot.
The pocket designated by a player to which a ball is to be shot.
1.  The red object ball in carom billiards games.
1.  Carom came into use in the 1860s and is a shortening of carambola, which was earlier used to describe the red object ball used in many billiards games.
2.  More specifically, short for a carom shot, a cannon in British terminology, in which a point is scored in carom billiards games by careening the cue ball into the two object balls.
3.  In pocket games as a general class, carom or carom shot is sometimes used more loosely, between the above two definitions, to refer to clipping an object ball with the cue ball to attempt to send either or both to desirable locations, not necessarily scoring in the process.
In games in which pocketing the cue ball is a goal (e.g. Russian pyramid), carom can refer to sending the cue ball into a pocket after contacting an object ball (called a losing hazard in English billiards, it nevertheless scores points; but it is a foul in snooker, called an in-off, and in pool, called a scratch).
It is played on a table without pockets, and scoring is generally done by driving a cue ball into contact with one object ball, then having the cue ball contact one or more cushions before contacting another object ball; however, there are numerous variations, some of which involve additional objects, such as upright pins as targets or hazards.
In snooker, English billiards and other British usage, a break of 100 points or more, which requires potting at least 25 balls consecutively, in snooker, but can be earned via a combination of scoring techniques in English billiards, etc.
Cheating the pocket is employed for position play, to allow a ball to pass another partially obscuring the path to the pocket, and to prevent scratches on dead-straight shots in cases where draw is not desirable (or may not be dependable, e.g. because of distance from the pocket or smash-through).
A situation where the cue ball is directly in front of another ball in the line of the shot such that the player is hampered by it, having to bridge over it awkwardly with the likelihood of a foul looming if the object ball is inadvertently touched.
To play a shot with the stroke and speed that makes it easiest to pocket the object ball, even at the expense of sacrificing position.
To maneuver a ball on a shot so that it will be favorably positioned for later play into a particular pocket, even at the expense of sacrificing position or the inning to achieve that result.
Describing a shot in bar pool: the pocketing of an object ball in a manner such that the target object ball does not kiss any other object ball, and is not banked, kicked, caromed, or combo'd in, and without double-kissing, though it may hit the knuckles, and depending upon local bar-rules may be allowed to contact either of the cushions, not just at the knuckle, that run into the target pocket.
E.g., in a game of nine-ball, if the 1 and the 7 were clustered together along a cushion with the 9 behind them near a pocket, and the cue ball could strike the 1 full face with a result of the 1 heading off the 7 toward the top rail and the 7 rebounding quickly across the table from the cushion, the cue ball, with top spin could retain enough post-impact momentum to continue forward and pocket the 9 as long as both the 1 and the 7 were cleared out the way first.
In a game like eight-ball, a clearance shot might also be used at the end of an inning to move some problem balls that are blocking an otherwise easy run, and leave the cue ball in a safe position, in hopes of having a better layout to work with in the next inning.
Tickie shots are among the most common clearance approaches, especially for very short distances of intended cue ball travel past the initial contact.
A typical precaution against cling is to ask for the cue ball and/or object ball to be cleaned by the referee in order to remove chalk that is already on the ball prior to the shot; and (including in non-refereed games) players cleaning the cue ball personally after gaining ball-in-hand.
Side spin imparted to an object ball by the friction from the hit of the cue ball during a cut shot.
Any shot in which the cue ball contacts an object ball, which in turn hits one or more additional object balls (which in turn may hit yet further object balls) to send the last-hit object ball to an intended place, usually a pocket.
In snooker, when a player offers the frame to their opponent, even though balls remain on the table.
When the corner lip of a pocket blocks the path of the cue ball from contacting an intended object ball.
A type of nurse shot used in English billiards in which two coloured balls are positioned on either side of the mouth of a snooker table pocket but not touching and, thus placed, can be successively contacted and scored off over and over by the cue ball without moving them.
A British term describing a bank shot in which the cue ball crosses the future path of the object ball.
It is widely thought that better snooker players get lower to the table with their chins on the cue, have a straight back leg, their elbow hinging in line with the shot, and a straight follow-through after the cue ball has been struck.
cue ball 
A chiefly British term describing the amount of control a player can retain when playing shots with heavy spin and great pace; ""it took tremendous cue power to get onto the 2 ball having been relatively straight on the 1"".
The most common form of dead arrangements are the dead combination or dead combo (a combination shot in which contact with the first object ball will pocket another one), and the dead kiss, in which contact with the first object ball will pocket it off of another one.
Even cut shot angles may be affected because of the cling or skid (British: kick) effect, and professional players often ask a referee to clean a ball, mid-game.
dead ball shot 
1.  A cue sports game (such as eight-ball, three-cushion billiards, 18.2 balkline, etc.), especially as a professional or serious amateur specialization: ""He was a World Champion in three billiards disciplines.""
An illegal shot (foul) in which the cue stick's tip contacts the cue ball twice during a single stroke.
Double hits often occur when a player shoots the cue ball when it is very close to an object ball or cushion, because it is difficult to move the cue stick away quickly enough after the cue ball rebounds off the cushion or object ball.
A carom billiards shot, common in three-cushion billiards, where the cue ball is shot with reverse english at a relatively shallow angle down the rail, and spins backwards off the adjacent rail back into the first rail.
To intentionally rebound the cue ball off both of the pocket points to achieve position.
A shot played slowly and with heavy draw and follow-through so that the cue ball can be struck firmly but with a lot of the pace taken out, allowing more control than just a gentle tap that would travel as far.
Back spin slows the cue ball down, reduces its travel, and narrows both the carom angle after contact with an object ball, and angle of reflection off a cushion.
A shot in which the cue ball is struck below its equator with sufficient draw to make it reverse direction at the moment of contact with an object ball because it is still back-spinning.
When the object and cue balls are lined up square, the reversal will be directly backwards, while on a cut shot, the effect will alter the carom angle.
A break shot in pool on which zero object balls are potted.
A type of containing safety shot in snooker where the cue ball is played slowly up the table in order to ""dump"" it on the (usually) top cushion and leave the object ball safe.
They have in common the use of a rack of fifteen object balls and a single cue ball, a hard break from behind the head string or baulk line, and a goal of pocketing (potting) all of one's own suit of balls then finally the black 8 ball.
Ball-and-pocket are called for each shot, with fouls (faults) resulting in cue ball in-hand for the opponent, anywhere on the table.
Chiefly American: Also known as side spin, english (which is usually not capitalized) is spin placed on the cue ball when hit with the cue tip to the left or right of the ball's center.
English has a marked effect on cue ball rebound angle off cushions (though not off object balls), and is thus crucial for gaining shape; it can also be used to ""throw"" an object ball slightly off its otherwise expected trajectory, to cheat the pocket, and for other effects.
Pool facings are flat and angled rather wide, on pockets notably larger than the balls, to act much like the backboard in basketball, in that a shot can be directed into the facing to cause it to angle off the facing into the pocket.
Snooker facings are curved and not angled, providing a smooth transition between the rails and the pockets, which are not much wider than the balls, thus preventing any backboard effect (snooker shots must be almost perfectly straight in).
A very thin cut shot in which the cue ball just brushes the edge of an object ball.
Examples of flukes include an unexpected pot off several cushions or other balls having missed the pocket aimed for, or a lucky safety position after having missed a shot.
In many games, flukes result in a loss of turn, although some rule sets (most notably those of snooker, nine-ball and related games, and the eight-ball rules of the American Poolplayers Association and its affiliates) count flukes as valid, point-making shots.
The forward rotation of the cue ball that results from a follow shot.
A shot in which the cue ball is struck above its equator with sufficient top spin to cause the cue ball to travel forward after it contacts an object ball.
By contrast, on a cut shot, a cue ball with follow on it will first travel on the tangent line after striking the object ball, and then arc forward, widening the carom angle.
On a shot, the extension of the cue stick through the cue ball position during the end of a player's stroke in the direction originally aimed.
Chiefly American: The half of the table in which the object balls are racked (in games in which racked balls are used).
The point on the table surface over which the apex ball of a rack is centered (in most games).
A powerful follow shot with a high degree of top spin on it; usually when the object ball being hit is relatively close to the cue ball and is being hit very full; also known as ""prograde top spin"" or ""prograde follow"" (when referring to the action on the shot rather than the shot per se), and as a ""jenny"" in Australia.
Sometimes interchangeable with scratch, though the latter is often used only to refer to the foul of pocketing the cue ball.
In many pool games the penalty for a foul is ball-in-hand anywhere on the table for the opponent.
In one-pocket, in which a set number of balls must be made in a specific pocket, upon a foul the player must return a ball to the table.
In UK eight-ball this would normally give the opponent the option of one of two plays: (1) ball-in-hand with two shots; (2) being allowed to contact, or even pot, a ball other than one from their set from the snookered position (although the black may not be potted), with the loss of the first shot.
In addition, some variations of the game allow the player to pot one of the opposition's balls, on the first visit only, without the loss of a ""free shot"".
In snooker, it allows a player to call any ball as the ball they would have wanted to play, potting it for the same number of points, or the opponent can be put back in without the same privilege, having to play the ball snookered on.
In snooker (and some British pool rules), this is called a touching ball, and the cue ball must be shot away from the object ball without the latter moving.
It is commonly used in reference to how much of an object ball a player can see with the cue ball: ""Can you hit that full?"".
Nine-ball is a game.
game ball 
In the carom games, any shot where the end result is all the balls near each other; ideally, in position for the start of a nurse on the next stroke.
A common aiming method in which a phantom ball is imagined frozen to the object ball at the point where an imaginary line drawn between their centers is aimed at the desired target; the center of cue ball may then be shot at the center of the ""ghost"" ball (i.e., to precisely take the place of where that ball is imagined to be) and, ideally, impact the object ball at the proper contact point.
In nine-ball a break shot that pots the 9 ball without fouling, in which case the player wins in one shot.
1.  Nearly table-length distance between the cue ball and target object ball, or between an object ball and target pocket, i.e. a potentially difficult shot due to distance (""you sure left me a lot of green on that one"")
The spot (usually not specially marked because it is obvious) on a snooker table at which the green ball is placed.
A shot aimed so that the center of the cue ball is in line with the edge of the object ball, eclipsing half of the ball.
In snooker and other British usages, a break of between 50 and 99 points (100 points or more being called a century), which requires potting at least 12 consecutive balls (e.g. the last three reds with at least two blacks and a pink, followed by all the colours).
A ball hanging in the pocket – a ""hanger"" – is nearly unmissable (though fouling by scratching the cue ball into the pocket right after the object ball is a common mistake).
1.  An easily shot object ball that is ""hanging"" in the pocket.
1.  Literally, a pocket, but generally used in the phrases losing hazard – potting (pocketing) the cue ball off another ball – and winning hazard – using the cue ball to pot another ball – the two types of legal shots that pocket balls in games in which the term is used at all, which is very few today.
In most pool games, the opening break shot must be performed with the center (base) of the cue ball behind the head string (i.e. between the head string and head rail).
In snooker, to leave the cue ball ball on the spot of a colour ball after potting it.
This occurs at the start of a frame, and after the cue ball has been potted or forced off the table.
A player's (or doubles team's) turn at the table, usually ending with a failure to score a point or to pocket a ball, depending on the game, a foul, a safety or with a win.
(Chiefly British.) In snooker, English billiards, and blackball/eight-ball pool, an instance where the cue ball has been potted (pocketed) after contacting an object ball.
(Chiefly British.) In a snookers required situation in snooker, a shot played by the player defending the lead, where they play the object ball in such a way as to try to slowly pot (pocket) it, so that if it misses, at least it is over the pocket and difficult to obtain the required snooker from.
(Chiefly British) Said of an object ball that can easily be reached by the cue ball, or of a pocket that can easily be reached by a selected object ball, usually directly (i.e. without intervening kick, bank, carom, kiss or combination shots).
A ball that is easily made from many positions on the table but which is left untouched while the rack is played, so that in the event the player gets out of position, the shooter has an insurance shot.
In snooker, a phrase used to describe a situation where the player has an easy pot and in general the balls are in a position to go on to make a sizeable break.
When a particular ball is given as a handicap in nine-ball, designating that ball in turn means that it must be made in rotation, when it is the lowest numerical ball remaining on the table, and cannot be made to garner a win earlier in the game by way of a combination, carom or any other shot.
For example, if a player is spotted the 8 ball, they only win by making that ball after balls 1 through 7 have been cleared from the table.
Any shot where the cue ball is intentionally jumped into the air to clear an obstacle (usually an object ball, even in games with non-ball objects, e.g. bottle pool).
Jump shots must be performed by hitting the cue ball into the table's surface so that it rebounds off the cloth; scooping under the cue ball to fling it into the air is deemed a foul by all authoritative rules sources.
1.  A shot or ball that allows a player to obtain shape on another ball hard to play position to.
3.  The 14th object ball in a rack of straight pool that, when proper position is achieved on, allows easy position play, in turn, on the last (15th) object ball for an intergame break shot.
Because of the comparatively light weight of snooker balls, and much smaller margins of error due to tight pocket sizes on a very large table, the throw effect of a kick can cause a seemingly easy snooker shot to miss widely.
Even if the kick was mostly vertical, due to screw (bottom spin) or follow (top spin) rather than side spin, and the shot was potted, a kick often results in balls visibly jumping upon impact, resulting in a great loss of cue ball momentum, which can wreck the shot's position play and leave the player with poor options.
A shot in which the cue ball is driven to one or more rail or cushions before reaching its intended target—usually an object ball.
A shot intended to slow down or ""kill"" the cue ball's speed as much as possible after contact with an object ball; usually a shot with draw, often combined with inside english.
If the player's intention was to cause two object balls to kiss (e.g. to pocket a shot ball by ricocheting it off a stationary one), it is often called a kiss shot.
A shot in which the object is to pocket (pot) an object ball by striking it with the cue ball and then having the object ball ricochet off another object ball into a pocket.
The knuckles are protrusive and comparatively sharp on a pool table, the facings of which can be used like a basketball backboard to rebound a ball into a pocket.
To determine the order of play, players (representing only themselves, or sometimes teams) each near simultaneously shoot a ball from the kitchen (or in British games, from the baulk line) to the end rail and back toward the bottom rail.
A common rule in informal bar pool, especially bar/pub eight-ball, in which the money ball must be pocketed (potted) in the same pocket as the shooter's last object ball (each player may be said to eventually ""own"" a pocket, for the duration of the game, in which their 8 ball shot must be played if they have already run out their suit).
The variant is not extremely common in the United States or the UK, but is near-universal in much of Latin America (where two cue ball scratches are permitted when attempting the 8 ball shot and count as simple fouls, with only a third scratch constituting a loss of game).
Last-pocket rules require careful position play, and frequently result in bank and kick shots with the 8 ball.
An organization that promotes competitive, usually team, amateur cue sports, most commonly pool, especially eight-ball and nine-ball, although there are also well-established snooker leagues.
The cue ball's position after a shot.
A legal hit is one in which the requirements for a non-foul hit are met (e.g., in nine-ball, the lowest-numbered ball on the table was hit by the cue ball first, and at least one object ball was pocketed, or any ball reached a cushion, after the hit on the first object ball.).
A legal shot is one in which no foul of any kind was involved (e.g. there was not a double hit by the cue, the player's bridge hand did not move a ball, etc.).
A legal stroke is one in which the cue stroke obeyed the rules (e.g. the shooter did not perform an illegal jump shot by scooping under the cue ball with the cue tip).
In snooker, a pot into any of the corner pockets where the cue ball had started in the opposite lengthwise half of the table.
In other words, a pot in which the cue ball or object ball crosses an imaginary line joining the middle pockets.
A shot in which the cue ball is potted after caroming off another ball.
1.  In snooker, a trick shot that involves lining up a number of balls, for example along the baulk line, then, after striking the cue ball toward a corner pocket, hitting the other balls directly with the cue stick into that pocket before the cue ball reaches it.
2.  In pool, a trick shot where a number of object balls are placed in a row to form a line, sometimes near a cushion, or in a line and the cue ball is shot into the balls so as to reverberate between them while traveling and hit each one of the object balls in series, issuing a machine gun-like sound.
Sometimes played intentionally to avoid a double hit when the cue ball is very close to an object ball or cushion.
The miss rule gives the opponent the option to have the referee replace the balls to their original positions and make the player take the shot again.
If a money ball is illegally pocketed, it usually results in a loss of game, or a foul.
In snooker and UK eight-ball especially, this creates the effect of creep in the direction of the nap, the most-affected shot being a slow roll into a center pocket against the nap.
A natural bank shot, for example, is one in which simply shooting straight into the object ball at medium speed and with no spin will send the object ball directly into the target pocket on the other side of the table.
3.  In three cushion billiards, the easiest type of shot, in which the second object ball is advantageously placed in a corner.
It is a rotation game, in which the lowest-numbered object ball must be hit first (though balls may be pocketed in any order, such as with a carom shot or combination shot).
The game ends when the 9 ball is legally pocketed, either as the last remaining object ball, or early as long as the lowest-numbered ball was struck first.
A short, jabbed draw stroke usually employed so as to not commit a foul (i.e. due to following through to a double hit) when the cue ball is very near to the target object ball.
In carom billiards games, when all the balls are kept near each other and a cushion so that with very soft shots the balls can be ""nursed"" down a rail, allowing multiple successful shots that effectively replicate the same ball setup so that the nurse shots can be continued almost indefinitely, unless a limit is imposed by the rules.
Excessive use of nurse shots in straight rail by players skilled enough to set them up and pull them off repeatedly at will is what led to the development of the balkline and one-cushion game variations, and repetitive shot limitation rules in English billiards.
1.  pool: See Having the cue ball on a string.
As a result of the opening break shot (the ""snap""), usually said of winning by pocketing the money ball (""won on the snap"", ""got it on the snap"", etc.) Employed most commonly in the game of nine-ball where pocketing the 9 ball at any time in the game on a legal stroke, including the break shot, is a win.
One of the most challenging pool games, in which each player is designated a specific corner pocket on the foot rail, and can only score by pocketing the object balls into it.
A requirement under some pool rulesets that either an object ball be pocketed, or at least four object balls be driven to contact the cushions, on the opening break shot.
A description of play in carom billiards games in which the balls remain widely separated rather than gathered, requiring much more skill to score points and making nurse shots effectively impossible, and making for a more interesting game for onlookers.
To illustrate, the 6-out in a nine-ball game would allow the player getting weight to win by legally pocketing the 6, 7, 8 or 9 balls.
Side spin on a cue ball on the opposite side of the direction of the cut angle to be played (right-hand english when cutting an object ball to the left, and vice versa).
1.  Having the cue ball stop at or near the center of the table on a forceful break shot (the breaking ideal in many games such as nine-ball);
Small, round markers typically numbered 1 through 16, which are placed in a bottle for various random assignment purposes, such as in a tournament roster, to assign order of play in a multiplayer game, or to assign particular balls to players in games such as kelly pool.
The object balls remain nearly stationary, and the player can then play a shot that reverses the striking order of the cue ball against to object balls.
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the pink ball is placed.
In snooker, hitting the cue ball in the center, without any spin.
1.  (noun) An opening in a billiards table, cut partly into the bed and partly into the rails and their cushions, into which balls are shot (pocketed or potted).
1.  Describes the propensity of table pockets to more easily accept an imperfectly aimed ball shot at a relatively soft speed, that might not fall if shot with more velocity (""that ball normally wouldn't fall but he hit it at pocket speed"").
2.  Describes the velocity of an object ball shot with just enough speed to reach the intended pocket and drop.
""Shoot this with pocket speed only, so you don't send the cue ball too far up-table.""
A tactic employed in UK eight-ball pool in which a player calls and pots one of the balls in a favorably lying set, then plays safe, leaving as many of their well-placed balls on the table as possible, until the opponents commits a foul or leaves a chance that the player feels warrants an attempt at running out.
A British term for someone with little experience or understanding of the game, who may be skilled at potting individual balls but does not consider tactics such as position or safety; ""he's a potter, not a player."" Compare U.S. banger.
Erring too much in this direction is ""missing on the professional side of the pocket."" It is so called because experienced players understand that on a thin cut, overcutting the object ball to a corner pocket will far more often leave the object ball in an unfavorable position, i.e. along the short rail for the incoming opponent than will an undercut, which often leaves the object ball sitting in front of or nearby the pocket it had been intended for on a miss.
By contrast, in eight-ball, except when both players are shooting at the 8 ball, the incoming player after a miss is shooting for different object balls, so this maxim does not apply, and the opposite may be good strategy as, if the object ball stays near the pocket through an undercut, it is advantageously positioned for a subsequent turn and may block the opponent's use of the pocket.
A rule in many games (most notably nine-ball, after and only after the break shot), allowing a player to ""push out"" the cue ball to a new position without having to contact any ball, much less pocket one or drive it to a cushion, but not counting any pocketed ball as valid (other foul rules apply, such as double hits, scratching the cue ball, etc.), with the caveat that the opponent may shoot from the new cue ball position or give the shot back to the pusher who must shoot from the new position.
In nine-ball particularly, and derived games such as seven-ball and ten-ball, pocketing the money ball on a push-out results in that ball being respotted (which can be used to strategic advantage in certain circumstances, such as when the break leaves no shot on the ball-on, and failure to hit it would give the incoming player an instant-win combination shot on the money ball).
Any foul shot in which a player's cue tip stays in contact with the cue ball for more than the momentary time commensurate with a stroked shot.
In the game of snooker, it is considered a push if the cue strikes the cue ball more than once in a given shot (a double hit) or if the cue stick, cue ball, and ball-on are all in contact together during a shot (if the cue ball and object ball began frozen together, the player must shoot away from that object ball without moving it and the touching ball rule applies).
1.  The full fifteen ball set of pool or snooker object balls after being racked, before the break shot (i.e., same as rack, definition 2, and triangle, defn.
The act of setting up the balls for a break shot.
Chiefly American: In pool games, when a player racks the object balls, and the breaking opponent does not pocket a ball on the break, and the person who racked the game commences to run out all of the remaining object balls without the breaker getting another visit at the table.
3.  In carom billiards, the object ball that is neither player's cue ball.
Other duties of the referee include racking each frame, re-spotting balls during the course of a game, maintaining the equipment associated with the table (e.g. keeping the balls clean), controlling the crowd and, if necessary, controlling the players.
2.  In pool, placing of the object balls back in the rack, after a foul break.
In snooker, a situation where the scores are tied after all the balls have been potted, and the black ball is re-spotted and the first player to pot it wins.
The players toss for the first shot, which must be taken with the cue ball in the D.
3.  A nine-ball ring game is played by more than two players and has special rules.
A pool table spread in which the balls are extremely easily positioned for a run out, and where little movement of the cue ball on each shot is necessary to obtain position on the next.
Their weight has a strong effect on play, as they are difficult to draw (screw), stop and stun, and generate a large amount of smash-through, compared to standard and magnetic cue balls, but do not reduce cut shot accuracy like grapefruit balls.
It is most common in the game of snooker, and is often results in a foul in many pool games, where after the cue ball has contacted a legal object ball either any ball must contact a cushion or any object ball must be pocketed.
A roll-up can be legal in such games when the object ball used for the tactic is very close to a cushion, so that either it or the cue ball lightly touch the cushion after ball-on-ball contact.
The term actually derives from the set-up of the game Chicago, in which the balls are not racked, but placed numerically around the table along the cushions (and must be shot in ascending order).
Describing a shot that requires one or more balls to be played off several cushions, such as an elaborate escape or a positional shot; ""he'll have to send the cue ball round the angles to get good position.""
The number of balls pocketed in an inning in pool (e.g., a run of five balls), or points scored in a row in carom billiards (e.g., a run of five points).
In English billiards, running a coup is when a player, from ball in hand, directly pockets the cue-ball when no ball(s) are out of baulk.
2.  A shot that is called aloud as part of a game's rules; once invoked, a safety usually allows the player to pocket their own object ball without having to shoot again, for strategic purposes.
A form of doubles (pairs) play in which the two team members take turns, playing alternating shots during an inning (i.e., each team's inning consists of two players' alternating visits, each of one shot only, until that team's inning ends, and the next team begins their alternating-shot turn, or the frame ends.) Effective scotch doubles play requires close rapport between team partners, especially as to advantageous cue ball position for the incoming player; whether the pair may directly communicate with each other during their inning varies by rule set.
A wall-mounted, usually wooden rack with several numbered shelves to hold each player's pocketed balls, used for keeping score between players of games in which points are awarded by the numerical values on the balls.
Pocketing of the cue ball, in pool games.
To be able to clearly see a path to a pocket or object ball without any other obstacle interfering, usually as a straight shot: ""The 3 ball is hanging in the pocket, but I can't see it because the 9 ball is in my way.""
A moderate curve imparted to the path of the cue ball by an elevated hit with use of english (side); or a shot using this technique.
1.  (Of a player or referee) to place the balls (and other items, if applicable, such as skittles) properly for the beginning of a game: ""In eight-ball, properly setting up requires that the rear corners of the rack not have two stripes or two solids but one of each."" For most games this is in a racked pattern, but the term is applicable more broadly than ""rack"", e.g. in carom billiards and in games like bottle pool.
4.  (Of a player, passively, generally, and chiefly US) to be in a favorable position for, and with a layout conductive to, a long run (UK: break) or complete run-out: ""a crucial miss that left their opponent really set-up""; compare (chiefly British) ""in the balls""
5.  (Of a player, actively) to use position play to move one or more specific balls to specific locations with a specific goal in mind, usually pocketing (potting) a specific ball or getting an easy out, but possibly a safety, nurse or trap shot; in short, to get shape: ""She set up on the 9-ball with a careful draw shot."" The meaning can be inverted to indicate poor play on the part of the other player: ""Oops, I just set you up for an easy win when I missed like that.""
7.  (Of cue ball position more specifically): having good shape – comparatively easy to use to some advantage, such as continuing a run (UK: break) or playing safe: ""The cue ball's set up for an easy side pocket shot.""
An additional difference from nine-ball-style rules is that the 7 must be pocketed in a specific side of the table (each player being assigned one at the beginning of the game).
A pocket; usually used in disgust when describing a scratch (e.g., ""the cue ball's gone down the sewer"").
When playing a shot, the two rails nearest to the pocket on a standard pool, billiards or snooker table.
The use of the cue to perform or attempt to perform a particular motion of balls on the table, such as to pocket (pot) an object ball, to achieve a successful carom (cannon), or to play a safety.
Spin placed on the cue ball when hit with the cue tip to the left or right of the ball's center; usually called english in American usage.
The effect of shooting regulation-weight object balls with an old-fashioned over-weight bar table cue ball, such that the cue ball moves forward to occupy (sometimes only temporarily), or go beyond, the original position of the object ball, even on a draw or stop shot, because the mass of the cue ball exceeds that of the object ball.
Smash-through also makes it dangerous in bar pool (when equipped with such a cue ball) to pocket straight-on ducks with a stop shot instead of by cheating the pocket because of the likelihood of scratching the cue ball.
A British term for a pot that requires very fine contact between cue ball and object ball.
2.  (verb) To leave the opponent (accidentally or by means of a safety) so that a certain shot on a preferred object ball cannot be played directly in a straight line by normal cueing.
It can also refer to the potting angle or another significant point of contact on the object ball, blocking an otherwise more straightforward shot, even if an edge can be seen.
The use of the correct amount of cue ball speed in position play to achieve proper shape for a subsequent shot.
In pool, a type of shot in which two object balls are initially contacted by the cue ball simultaneously or so close to simultaneously as for the difference to be indistinguishable to the eye.
In most sets of rules it is a foul if the split is one in which one of the object balls is a (or the only) legal target (ball-on) and the other is not; however, such a split is commonly considered a legal shot in informal bar pool in many areas if it is called as a split and does appear to strike the balls simultaneously).
2.  In pool, the degree to which racked balls move apart upon impact by the cue ball as a result of a break shot.
3.  In snooker, a shot sending the cue ball into the pack of red balls and separating them (after potting the ball-on).
2.  spot, a: In snooker, any of the six designated points on the table on which a colour ball is replaced after it has left the playing surface (usually after it has been potted).
In carom billiards and English billiards, the second player's cue ball, which for the shooting player is another object ball along with the red.
Contrast the white ball, the starting player's cue ball.
1.  In pool, return an illegally pocketed object ball to the table by placement on the foot spot or as near to it as possible without moving other balls (in ways that may differ from ruleset to ruleset).
5.  In some variants of pool, to place the cue ball on the head spot or as near to it as possible inside the kitchen/baulk, after the opponent has scratched.
The situation arising in many pool games where a ball is spotted to the table's foot spot or some other specific location and the cue ball must be shot from the kitchen or the ""D"".
There are diamond system aiming techniques for pocketing such shots without scratching the cue ball into a pocket.
A form of nurse shot in English billiards, in which the red ball – which must be spotted to a specific location after each time it is potted, prior to the next shot being taken – is potted in such a way as to leave the cue ball in position to repeat the same shot, permitting a skilled player to rack up many points in a single break of these shots in one visit.
Any shot in which the cue ball or an object ball has to squeeze by (just miss with almost no margin for error) another ball or balls in order to reach its intended target.
In the UK, a long-distance shot played to pot a ball close to a pocket with heavy top spin, so that when the cue ball hits the cushion it bounces off but then stops due to the counteraction of the spin.
Any shot where the cue ball stops immediately after hitting an object ball.
A shot played with stun, but not quite enough to completely stop the cue ball, allowing for a little follow.
A shot where the cue ball has no top spin or back spin on it when it impacts an object ball, and ""stuns"" out along the tangent line.
A player skilled at very thin cut shots, and shots in which a ball must pass cleanly through a very narrow space (such as the cue ball between two of the opponent's object balls with barely enough room) to avoid a foul and/or to pocket a ball.
However, in some variants of bar pool a table scratch while shooting for the 8 ball is a loss of game where other more minor fouls might not be, as is scratching on the 8 ball (neither result in a loss of game in professional and most amateur league rules).
2.  By way of drift from the above definition, the term is also applied by many league players to the foul in more standardized rules of failing to drive a (any) ball to a cushion, or to pocket a legal object ball, after the cue ball's initial contact with an object ball.
Fast cloth can make draw (screw) shots somewhat less effective, as there is less purchase for the cue ball's back spin.
It is played by most of the same rules as nine-ball (especially that the lowest-numbered object ball remaining on the table must always be struck first by the cue ball), but differs (in the WPA standardized rules) in that shots must be called.
An amateur multi-player (and often gambling) game, played with three object balls, racked either in a triangle or a straight line toward the end rail from the foot spot.
The game is played by each player trying to pocket all three balls (the same player remaining at the table until this is done) in as few shots as possible and without incurring any fouls.
Luck plays a more significant role in this game than usual, due to the possibility of pocketing two or even all three balls on the break shot.
In nine-ball and straight pool, a player must be the told they are on two fouls in order to transgress the rule, and if violated, results in a loss of game for in former, and a special point penalty of a loss of fifteen points (plus one for the foul itself) in the latter together with the ability to require the violator to rerack and rebreak.
While throw is most easily observed between the cue ball and an object ball, it also happens between two or more object balls, which is one of the factors that makes combination shots challenging.
Skilled players thus often shoot cut shots with a small amount of outside english – gearing outside English – to neutralize the cut-induced throw that widens the shot away from the tangent line, though other techniques may be required instead or in combination with that, depending on the desired cue-ball position at the end of the shot.
A shot in which the cue ball is driven first to one or more rails, then hits an object ball and kisses back to the last rail contacted.
Any shot in which the cue ball moves another ball to a different position and then rebounds off one or more rails to contact the object ball again (normally in an attempt to pocket it or score a billiard).
1.  Chiefly British: The half of the table in which the object balls are racked (in games that use racked balls).
A term used in snooker for the potting of all the balls that are racked at the beginning of the frame in a single break (run).
The player must call ""total snooker"" to the referee, which allows a dispensation to the player from having to hit a cushion after contacting the object ball, which is otherwise a foul.
In snooker, the situation in which the cue ball is resting in contact with an object ball.
2.  The object balls in triangular formation, before the break shot, after being racked as above (i.e., same as rack, definition 2).
An exhibition shot designed to impress either by a player's skill or knowledge of how to set the balls up and take advantage of the angles of the table; usually a combination of both.
A British term for a type of bank shot in which the object ball is potted off two cushions, especially by sending it twice across the table and into a side pocket.
A rule in blackball whereby after an opponent has faulted and thus yielded two shots, if the incoming shooter pots a ball on the first shot, (s)he is still allowed to miss in a later shot and take a second shot in-hand (from the ""D"" or from baulk, or if the opponent potted the cue ball, from anywhere)—even on the black, in most variants.
Many local rules state the in-hand from the D (see D, the) or baulk (or if the opponent potted the cue ball, from anywhere) nature of the second shot is lost if a ball is potted on the first shot, that it is lost if the ball potted in the first shot was that player's last coloured ball (object ball in their group), and/or that there is only ever one shot on the black after a fault.
A three cushion billiards shot in which the cue ball first strikes two cushions before hitting the first object ball then hits a third cushion before hitting the second object ball.
Umbrella shots may be classified as inside or outside depending on which side of the first object ball the cue ball contacts.
A British term describing when a ball is tight on the cushion and a player sends the cue ball to hit both the object ball and the rail at nearly the same time; the object ball, ideally, stays tight to the rail and is thus ""velcroed"" to the rail.
An object ball positioned near a pocket so that another object ball shot at that pocket will likely go in off the warrior, even if aimed so imperfectly that if the warrior had been absent, the shot likely would have missed.
2.  In games where multiple balls must be pocketed in succession to score a specific number of points, such as cribbage pool, when the last ball necessary to score has been potted, the points total given is referred to as a ""way"".
2.  In carom billiards games and English billiards, a more specific term for the starting opponent's cue ball, which for the shooting player is another object ball along with the red.
Contrast spot ball, the other player's cue ball.
Shooting at an object ball that is already in motion (""on the wing"") at the moment of shooting and cue ball impact; it is a foul in most games, and usually only seen in trick shots and in speed pool.
A shot in which the cue ball is used to pot another ball.
In snooker and most pool games doing this is known as potting, pocketing or sinking the targeted ball.
Whether the ball is an object ball or an opponent's cue ball depends upon the type of game (some have two cue balls).
The move will score points in most (but not all) games in which hazards (as such) apply, such as English billiards (in which a ""red winner"" is the potting of the red ball and a ""white winner"" the potting of the opponent's cue ball, each worth a different number of points).
The spot (usually not specially marked because it is obvious) on a snooker table at which the yellow ball is placed."
bank,"Two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker 's lifetime , and the proviso made that as long as Brian Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees ( hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail .",['d001.s081.t018'],['bank%1:14:00::'],['sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)'],"The following is a glossary of traditional English-language terms used in the three overarching cue sports disciplines: carom billiards referring to the various carom games played on a billiard table without pockets; pool, which denotes a host of games played on a table with six pockets; and snooker, played on a large pocket table, and which has a sport culture unto itself distinct from pool.
1 ball 
2 ball 
3 ball 
4 ball 
5 ball 
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining five object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 6.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining six object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 7.
(Pocketing the 8 early is a loss of game—unless done on the break shot, in most rules variants.) In other games, such as nine-ball and straight pool, the 8 is simply another object ball.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining eight object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 9.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining nine object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 10, and the 10 ball and pocket are called.
Used in snooker in reference to the position of the cue ball.
In snooker and pool, a cue ball situated in the jaws of a pocket such that a/the ball-on cannot be struck directly.
The ball placed at the front of a group of racked object balls (i.e., toward the breaker and furthest from the racker), and in most games situated over the table's foot spot.
In carom games, a shot in which in attempting to score, the cue ball contacts three or more cushions, usually including both short rails.
Used in snooker to describe the path that the cue ball must take into and out of baulk as a result of poor position play, specifically coming around the baulk colours off three or more cushions, normally on a shot on the blue to finish on a red as a result of finishing low on the blue.
A cut shot in which if a line were drawn from the cue ball to the rail behind the targeted object ball, perpendicular to that rail, the object ball would lie beyond the line with respect to the pocket being targeted.
This balk is where the cue ball is placed in lagging for lead, for making the opening break shot, and sometimes for other purposes, depending upon the game.
In the eponymous balkline billiards there are four balklines, drawn parallel to and typically 14 or 18 inches from the cushions of the table, dividing it into nine compartments or divisions, of which the outside eight are the balks, in which only a set number of caroms may be scored before at least one ball must leave the area.
The option of placing the cue ball anywhere on the table prior to shooting, in a game of pool.
A common variation, used in games such as straight pool and often in bar pool, is ball-in-hand ""behind the head string"", also ""behind the line"" or ""from the kitchen"", meaning the ball-in-hand option is restricted to placement anywhere behind the head string, i.e., in the area of the table known as the kitchen.
Coin-operated bar tables have ball-return mechanisms that separate the cue ball from the object balls so that the object balls are captured when pocketed until the game ends, then released when paid for again, while the cue ball is continually returned for continued play after scratches.
There are tables that use optical sensors to distinguish a standard cue ball from object balls.
Some of them are also setup to return the 8 ball as well, so that pocketing it on the break does not end the game.
Shot in which an object ball is driven to one or more rails prior to being pocketed (or in some contexts, prior to reaching its intended target; not necessarily a pocket).
A rule variant common in bar pool versions of eight-ball, in which the 8-ball must be pocketed on a bank shot (generally this would either be accomplished via a bank shot proper or a kick shot); shooting the 8 straight in is a loss of game.
Pool, almost always a variant of eight-ball, that is played by bar players on a bar table.
Typical differences between bar pool and tournament eight-ball are the lack of ball-in-hand after a foul, the elimination of a number of fouls, and (with numbered ball sets) the requirement that most aspects of a shot be called (including cushions and other object balls to be contacted) not just the target ball and pocket.
Another distinguishing factor is the cue ball; these tables capture pocketed object balls to remove them from play, but selectively return a scratched cue ball.
Used in snooker in reference to the position of the cue ball.
A pool and occasionally snooker term (inherited from carom billiards by way of ""big ball"", above), it is a metaphor for a shot that is very difficult to miss pocketing for any of a number of reasons, most commonly: either the object ball is positioned such that a near miss on one side of it will likely cause the cue ball to rebound off the rail into the object ball and pocket it anyway; or another ball is positioned such that if the target ball does not go straight in, it is still likely to go in off the other ball in a kiss.
1.  Any shot in which the cue ball is caromed off an object ball to strike another object ball (with or without contacting cushions in the interim).
2.  In certain carom billiards games such as three-cushion, a successful attempt at making a scoring billiard shot under the rules for that game (such as contacting three cushions with the cue ball while executing the billiard).
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the black ball is placed.
1.  In snooker, the colour ball worth five points, placed on the blue spot in the centre of the table.
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the blue ball is placed.
The bottle used in various games to hold numbered peas, it is employed to assign random spots to players in a roster (such as in a tournament), or to assign random balls to players of a game (such as in kelly pool and bottle pool).
In carom games it describes the first point attempt, as shot from an unvarying cue ball and object balls placement; in many pool games it describes the first shot, which is used to separate the object balls that have been racked together;
Chiefly American: In pool games, when a player breaks the racked object balls, pockets at least one ball on the break, and commences to run out the remaining object balls without the opponent getting a visit at the table.
In straight pool, the last object ball left on a table before the remaining fourteen balls must be racked so the player at the table may continue their run.
It is called the ""break ball"" because it is common for players to try to leave this ball in such a position that they may easily pot it and billiard off of it to break open the rack of fourteen balls and continue their run.
In European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF) nine-ball, the break box is a zone in the ""kitchen"" of the head (British: bottom) of the table, from which the break shot must be taken with the cue ball.
This departure from WPA World Standardised Rules defeats the common break-from-the-side-rail technique for pocketing the 9 ball to win the game on the break; while 9 ball breaks are still possible, they are much more difficult under this rule.
The spot (often not marked) on a snooker table at which the brown ball is placed.
For example, in straight pool a player must call the pocket in which a ball is intended to be potted.
Applies specifically to games that enforce ""call-pocket/call-safe"" rules, which require the player to either call the ball and pocket, or call a safety on every shot.
After a legal shot, where a called ball is not pocketed as designated, the incoming player has the option to pass the shot back to the player who missed the called shot.
A call-shot/call-safe nine-ball example: Player A calls the ball-on, the 3 ball in this case, in the corner pocket but misses the shot.
The cue ball rolls down table and comes to rest behind the 5 ball leaving no clear path to the 3 ball for the incoming player B.
Describes any game in which during normal play a player must call the ball to be hit and the intended pocket; ""eight-ball is a call-shot game."" Sometimes referred to as ""call[ed]-pocket"", ""ball-and-pocket rules"", etc., to distinguish it from the common North American bar pool practice of requiring every aspect of shots to be called, such as caroms, kicks, and cushions to be contacted (this is sometimes also ambiguously referred to as ""call-shot"", but more accurately termed ""call-everything"" or ""call-it-all"").
Commonly in bar rules terminology, call-shot indicates how the shot will be made as compared to call-pocket which means simply that the ball must go into that pocket, details unnecessary.
The ball designated by a player to be pocketed on a shot.
The pocket designated by a player to which a ball is to be shot.
1.  The red object ball in carom billiards games.
1.  Carom came into use in the 1860s and is a shortening of carambola, which was earlier used to describe the red object ball used in many billiards games.
2.  More specifically, short for a carom shot, a cannon in British terminology, in which a point is scored in carom billiards games by careening the cue ball into the two object balls.
3.  In pocket games as a general class, carom or carom shot is sometimes used more loosely, between the above two definitions, to refer to clipping an object ball with the cue ball to attempt to send either or both to desirable locations, not necessarily scoring in the process.
In games in which pocketing the cue ball is a goal (e.g. Russian pyramid), carom can refer to sending the cue ball into a pocket after contacting an object ball (called a losing hazard in English billiards, it nevertheless scores points; but it is a foul in snooker, called an in-off, and in pool, called a scratch).
It is played on a table without pockets, and scoring is generally done by driving a cue ball into contact with one object ball, then having the cue ball contact one or more cushions before contacting another object ball; however, there are numerous variations, some of which involve additional objects, such as upright pins as targets or hazards.
In snooker, English billiards and other British usage, a break of 100 points or more, which requires potting at least 25 balls consecutively, in snooker, but can be earned via a combination of scoring techniques in English billiards, etc.
Cheating the pocket is employed for position play, to allow a ball to pass another partially obscuring the path to the pocket, and to prevent scratches on dead-straight shots in cases where draw is not desirable (or may not be dependable, e.g. because of distance from the pocket or smash-through).
A situation where the cue ball is directly in front of another ball in the line of the shot such that the player is hampered by it, having to bridge over it awkwardly with the likelihood of a foul looming if the object ball is inadvertently touched.
To play a shot with the stroke and speed that makes it easiest to pocket the object ball, even at the expense of sacrificing position.
To maneuver a ball on a shot so that it will be favorably positioned for later play into a particular pocket, even at the expense of sacrificing position or the inning to achieve that result.
Describing a shot in bar pool: the pocketing of an object ball in a manner such that the target object ball does not kiss any other object ball, and is not banked, kicked, caromed, or combo'd in, and without double-kissing, though it may hit the knuckles, and depending upon local bar-rules may be allowed to contact either of the cushions, not just at the knuckle, that run into the target pocket.
E.g., in a game of nine-ball, if the 1 and the 7 were clustered together along a cushion with the 9 behind them near a pocket, and the cue ball could strike the 1 full face with a result of the 1 heading off the 7 toward the top rail and the 7 rebounding quickly across the table from the cushion, the cue ball, with top spin could retain enough post-impact momentum to continue forward and pocket the 9 as long as both the 1 and the 7 were cleared out the way first.
In a game like eight-ball, a clearance shot might also be used at the end of an inning to move some problem balls that are blocking an otherwise easy run, and leave the cue ball in a safe position, in hopes of having a better layout to work with in the next inning.
Tickie shots are among the most common clearance approaches, especially for very short distances of intended cue ball travel past the initial contact.
A typical precaution against cling is to ask for the cue ball and/or object ball to be cleaned by the referee in order to remove chalk that is already on the ball prior to the shot; and (including in non-refereed games) players cleaning the cue ball personally after gaining ball-in-hand.
Side spin imparted to an object ball by the friction from the hit of the cue ball during a cut shot.
Any shot in which the cue ball contacts an object ball, which in turn hits one or more additional object balls (which in turn may hit yet further object balls) to send the last-hit object ball to an intended place, usually a pocket.
In snooker, when a player offers the frame to their opponent, even though balls remain on the table.
When the corner lip of a pocket blocks the path of the cue ball from contacting an intended object ball.
A type of nurse shot used in English billiards in which two coloured balls are positioned on either side of the mouth of a snooker table pocket but not touching and, thus placed, can be successively contacted and scored off over and over by the cue ball without moving them.
A British term describing a bank shot in which the cue ball crosses the future path of the object ball.
It is widely thought that better snooker players get lower to the table with their chins on the cue, have a straight back leg, their elbow hinging in line with the shot, and a straight follow-through after the cue ball has been struck.
cue ball 
A chiefly British term describing the amount of control a player can retain when playing shots with heavy spin and great pace; ""it took tremendous cue power to get onto the 2 ball having been relatively straight on the 1"".
The most common form of dead arrangements are the dead combination or dead combo (a combination shot in which contact with the first object ball will pocket another one), and the dead kiss, in which contact with the first object ball will pocket it off of another one.
Even cut shot angles may be affected because of the cling or skid (British: kick) effect, and professional players often ask a referee to clean a ball, mid-game.
dead ball shot 
1.  A cue sports game (such as eight-ball, three-cushion billiards, 18.2 balkline, etc.), especially as a professional or serious amateur specialization: ""He was a World Champion in three billiards disciplines.""
An illegal shot (foul) in which the cue stick's tip contacts the cue ball twice during a single stroke.
Double hits often occur when a player shoots the cue ball when it is very close to an object ball or cushion, because it is difficult to move the cue stick away quickly enough after the cue ball rebounds off the cushion or object ball.
A carom billiards shot, common in three-cushion billiards, where the cue ball is shot with reverse english at a relatively shallow angle down the rail, and spins backwards off the adjacent rail back into the first rail.
To intentionally rebound the cue ball off both of the pocket points to achieve position.
A shot played slowly and with heavy draw and follow-through so that the cue ball can be struck firmly but with a lot of the pace taken out, allowing more control than just a gentle tap that would travel as far.
Back spin slows the cue ball down, reduces its travel, and narrows both the carom angle after contact with an object ball, and angle of reflection off a cushion.
A shot in which the cue ball is struck below its equator with sufficient draw to make it reverse direction at the moment of contact with an object ball because it is still back-spinning.
When the object and cue balls are lined up square, the reversal will be directly backwards, while on a cut shot, the effect will alter the carom angle.
A break shot in pool on which zero object balls are potted.
A type of containing safety shot in snooker where the cue ball is played slowly up the table in order to ""dump"" it on the (usually) top cushion and leave the object ball safe.
They have in common the use of a rack of fifteen object balls and a single cue ball, a hard break from behind the head string or baulk line, and a goal of pocketing (potting) all of one's own suit of balls then finally the black 8 ball.
Ball-and-pocket are called for each shot, with fouls (faults) resulting in cue ball in-hand for the opponent, anywhere on the table.
Chiefly American: Also known as side spin, english (which is usually not capitalized) is spin placed on the cue ball when hit with the cue tip to the left or right of the ball's center.
English has a marked effect on cue ball rebound angle off cushions (though not off object balls), and is thus crucial for gaining shape; it can also be used to ""throw"" an object ball slightly off its otherwise expected trajectory, to cheat the pocket, and for other effects.
Pool facings are flat and angled rather wide, on pockets notably larger than the balls, to act much like the backboard in basketball, in that a shot can be directed into the facing to cause it to angle off the facing into the pocket.
Snooker facings are curved and not angled, providing a smooth transition between the rails and the pockets, which are not much wider than the balls, thus preventing any backboard effect (snooker shots must be almost perfectly straight in).
A very thin cut shot in which the cue ball just brushes the edge of an object ball.
Examples of flukes include an unexpected pot off several cushions or other balls having missed the pocket aimed for, or a lucky safety position after having missed a shot.
In many games, flukes result in a loss of turn, although some rule sets (most notably those of snooker, nine-ball and related games, and the eight-ball rules of the American Poolplayers Association and its affiliates) count flukes as valid, point-making shots.
The forward rotation of the cue ball that results from a follow shot.
A shot in which the cue ball is struck above its equator with sufficient top spin to cause the cue ball to travel forward after it contacts an object ball.
By contrast, on a cut shot, a cue ball with follow on it will first travel on the tangent line after striking the object ball, and then arc forward, widening the carom angle.
On a shot, the extension of the cue stick through the cue ball position during the end of a player's stroke in the direction originally aimed.
Chiefly American: The half of the table in which the object balls are racked (in games in which racked balls are used).
The point on the table surface over which the apex ball of a rack is centered (in most games).
A powerful follow shot with a high degree of top spin on it; usually when the object ball being hit is relatively close to the cue ball and is being hit very full; also known as ""prograde top spin"" or ""prograde follow"" (when referring to the action on the shot rather than the shot per se), and as a ""jenny"" in Australia.
Sometimes interchangeable with scratch, though the latter is often used only to refer to the foul of pocketing the cue ball.
In many pool games the penalty for a foul is ball-in-hand anywhere on the table for the opponent.
In one-pocket, in which a set number of balls must be made in a specific pocket, upon a foul the player must return a ball to the table.
In UK eight-ball this would normally give the opponent the option of one of two plays: (1) ball-in-hand with two shots; (2) being allowed to contact, or even pot, a ball other than one from their set from the snookered position (although the black may not be potted), with the loss of the first shot.
In addition, some variations of the game allow the player to pot one of the opposition's balls, on the first visit only, without the loss of a ""free shot"".
In snooker, it allows a player to call any ball as the ball they would have wanted to play, potting it for the same number of points, or the opponent can be put back in without the same privilege, having to play the ball snookered on.
In snooker (and some British pool rules), this is called a touching ball, and the cue ball must be shot away from the object ball without the latter moving.
It is commonly used in reference to how much of an object ball a player can see with the cue ball: ""Can you hit that full?"".
Nine-ball is a game.
game ball 
In the carom games, any shot where the end result is all the balls near each other; ideally, in position for the start of a nurse on the next stroke.
A common aiming method in which a phantom ball is imagined frozen to the object ball at the point where an imaginary line drawn between their centers is aimed at the desired target; the center of cue ball may then be shot at the center of the ""ghost"" ball (i.e., to precisely take the place of where that ball is imagined to be) and, ideally, impact the object ball at the proper contact point.
In nine-ball a break shot that pots the 9 ball without fouling, in which case the player wins in one shot.
1.  Nearly table-length distance between the cue ball and target object ball, or between an object ball and target pocket, i.e. a potentially difficult shot due to distance (""you sure left me a lot of green on that one"")
The spot (usually not specially marked because it is obvious) on a snooker table at which the green ball is placed.
A shot aimed so that the center of the cue ball is in line with the edge of the object ball, eclipsing half of the ball.
In snooker and other British usages, a break of between 50 and 99 points (100 points or more being called a century), which requires potting at least 12 consecutive balls (e.g. the last three reds with at least two blacks and a pink, followed by all the colours).
A ball hanging in the pocket – a ""hanger"" – is nearly unmissable (though fouling by scratching the cue ball into the pocket right after the object ball is a common mistake).
1.  An easily shot object ball that is ""hanging"" in the pocket.
1.  Literally, a pocket, but generally used in the phrases losing hazard – potting (pocketing) the cue ball off another ball – and winning hazard – using the cue ball to pot another ball – the two types of legal shots that pocket balls in games in which the term is used at all, which is very few today.
In most pool games, the opening break shot must be performed with the center (base) of the cue ball behind the head string (i.e. between the head string and head rail).
In snooker, to leave the cue ball ball on the spot of a colour ball after potting it.
This occurs at the start of a frame, and after the cue ball has been potted or forced off the table.
A player's (or doubles team's) turn at the table, usually ending with a failure to score a point or to pocket a ball, depending on the game, a foul, a safety or with a win.
(Chiefly British.) In snooker, English billiards, and blackball/eight-ball pool, an instance where the cue ball has been potted (pocketed) after contacting an object ball.
(Chiefly British.) In a snookers required situation in snooker, a shot played by the player defending the lead, where they play the object ball in such a way as to try to slowly pot (pocket) it, so that if it misses, at least it is over the pocket and difficult to obtain the required snooker from.
(Chiefly British) Said of an object ball that can easily be reached by the cue ball, or of a pocket that can easily be reached by a selected object ball, usually directly (i.e. without intervening kick, bank, carom, kiss or combination shots).
A ball that is easily made from many positions on the table but which is left untouched while the rack is played, so that in the event the player gets out of position, the shooter has an insurance shot.
In snooker, a phrase used to describe a situation where the player has an easy pot and in general the balls are in a position to go on to make a sizeable break.
When a particular ball is given as a handicap in nine-ball, designating that ball in turn means that it must be made in rotation, when it is the lowest numerical ball remaining on the table, and cannot be made to garner a win earlier in the game by way of a combination, carom or any other shot.
For example, if a player is spotted the 8 ball, they only win by making that ball after balls 1 through 7 have been cleared from the table.
Any shot where the cue ball is intentionally jumped into the air to clear an obstacle (usually an object ball, even in games with non-ball objects, e.g. bottle pool).
Jump shots must be performed by hitting the cue ball into the table's surface so that it rebounds off the cloth; scooping under the cue ball to fling it into the air is deemed a foul by all authoritative rules sources.
1.  A shot or ball that allows a player to obtain shape on another ball hard to play position to.
3.  The 14th object ball in a rack of straight pool that, when proper position is achieved on, allows easy position play, in turn, on the last (15th) object ball for an intergame break shot.
Because of the comparatively light weight of snooker balls, and much smaller margins of error due to tight pocket sizes on a very large table, the throw effect of a kick can cause a seemingly easy snooker shot to miss widely.
Even if the kick was mostly vertical, due to screw (bottom spin) or follow (top spin) rather than side spin, and the shot was potted, a kick often results in balls visibly jumping upon impact, resulting in a great loss of cue ball momentum, which can wreck the shot's position play and leave the player with poor options.
A shot in which the cue ball is driven to one or more rail or cushions before reaching its intended target—usually an object ball.
A shot intended to slow down or ""kill"" the cue ball's speed as much as possible after contact with an object ball; usually a shot with draw, often combined with inside english.
If the player's intention was to cause two object balls to kiss (e.g. to pocket a shot ball by ricocheting it off a stationary one), it is often called a kiss shot.
A shot in which the object is to pocket (pot) an object ball by striking it with the cue ball and then having the object ball ricochet off another object ball into a pocket.
The knuckles are protrusive and comparatively sharp on a pool table, the facings of which can be used like a basketball backboard to rebound a ball into a pocket.
To determine the order of play, players (representing only themselves, or sometimes teams) each near simultaneously shoot a ball from the kitchen (or in British games, from the baulk line) to the end rail and back toward the bottom rail.
A common rule in informal bar pool, especially bar/pub eight-ball, in which the money ball must be pocketed (potted) in the same pocket as the shooter's last object ball (each player may be said to eventually ""own"" a pocket, for the duration of the game, in which their 8 ball shot must be played if they have already run out their suit).
The variant is not extremely common in the United States or the UK, but is near-universal in much of Latin America (where two cue ball scratches are permitted when attempting the 8 ball shot and count as simple fouls, with only a third scratch constituting a loss of game).
Last-pocket rules require careful position play, and frequently result in bank and kick shots with the 8 ball.
An organization that promotes competitive, usually team, amateur cue sports, most commonly pool, especially eight-ball and nine-ball, although there are also well-established snooker leagues.
The cue ball's position after a shot.
A legal hit is one in which the requirements for a non-foul hit are met (e.g., in nine-ball, the lowest-numbered ball on the table was hit by the cue ball first, and at least one object ball was pocketed, or any ball reached a cushion, after the hit on the first object ball.).
A legal shot is one in which no foul of any kind was involved (e.g. there was not a double hit by the cue, the player's bridge hand did not move a ball, etc.).
A legal stroke is one in which the cue stroke obeyed the rules (e.g. the shooter did not perform an illegal jump shot by scooping under the cue ball with the cue tip).
In snooker, a pot into any of the corner pockets where the cue ball had started in the opposite lengthwise half of the table.
In other words, a pot in which the cue ball or object ball crosses an imaginary line joining the middle pockets.
A shot in which the cue ball is potted after caroming off another ball.
1.  In snooker, a trick shot that involves lining up a number of balls, for example along the baulk line, then, after striking the cue ball toward a corner pocket, hitting the other balls directly with the cue stick into that pocket before the cue ball reaches it.
2.  In pool, a trick shot where a number of object balls are placed in a row to form a line, sometimes near a cushion, or in a line and the cue ball is shot into the balls so as to reverberate between them while traveling and hit each one of the object balls in series, issuing a machine gun-like sound.
Sometimes played intentionally to avoid a double hit when the cue ball is very close to an object ball or cushion.
The miss rule gives the opponent the option to have the referee replace the balls to their original positions and make the player take the shot again.
If a money ball is illegally pocketed, it usually results in a loss of game, or a foul.
In snooker and UK eight-ball especially, this creates the effect of creep in the direction of the nap, the most-affected shot being a slow roll into a center pocket against the nap.
A natural bank shot, for example, is one in which simply shooting straight into the object ball at medium speed and with no spin will send the object ball directly into the target pocket on the other side of the table.
3.  In three cushion billiards, the easiest type of shot, in which the second object ball is advantageously placed in a corner.
It is a rotation game, in which the lowest-numbered object ball must be hit first (though balls may be pocketed in any order, such as with a carom shot or combination shot).
The game ends when the 9 ball is legally pocketed, either as the last remaining object ball, or early as long as the lowest-numbered ball was struck first.
A short, jabbed draw stroke usually employed so as to not commit a foul (i.e. due to following through to a double hit) when the cue ball is very near to the target object ball.
In carom billiards games, when all the balls are kept near each other and a cushion so that with very soft shots the balls can be ""nursed"" down a rail, allowing multiple successful shots that effectively replicate the same ball setup so that the nurse shots can be continued almost indefinitely, unless a limit is imposed by the rules.
Excessive use of nurse shots in straight rail by players skilled enough to set them up and pull them off repeatedly at will is what led to the development of the balkline and one-cushion game variations, and repetitive shot limitation rules in English billiards.
1.  pool: See Having the cue ball on a string.
As a result of the opening break shot (the ""snap""), usually said of winning by pocketing the money ball (""won on the snap"", ""got it on the snap"", etc.) Employed most commonly in the game of nine-ball where pocketing the 9 ball at any time in the game on a legal stroke, including the break shot, is a win.
One of the most challenging pool games, in which each player is designated a specific corner pocket on the foot rail, and can only score by pocketing the object balls into it.
A requirement under some pool rulesets that either an object ball be pocketed, or at least four object balls be driven to contact the cushions, on the opening break shot.
A description of play in carom billiards games in which the balls remain widely separated rather than gathered, requiring much more skill to score points and making nurse shots effectively impossible, and making for a more interesting game for onlookers.
To illustrate, the 6-out in a nine-ball game would allow the player getting weight to win by legally pocketing the 6, 7, 8 or 9 balls.
Side spin on a cue ball on the opposite side of the direction of the cut angle to be played (right-hand english when cutting an object ball to the left, and vice versa).
1.  Having the cue ball stop at or near the center of the table on a forceful break shot (the breaking ideal in many games such as nine-ball);
Small, round markers typically numbered 1 through 16, which are placed in a bottle for various random assignment purposes, such as in a tournament roster, to assign order of play in a multiplayer game, or to assign particular balls to players in games such as kelly pool.
The object balls remain nearly stationary, and the player can then play a shot that reverses the striking order of the cue ball against to object balls.
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the pink ball is placed.
In snooker, hitting the cue ball in the center, without any spin.
1.  (noun) An opening in a billiards table, cut partly into the bed and partly into the rails and their cushions, into which balls are shot (pocketed or potted).
1.  Describes the propensity of table pockets to more easily accept an imperfectly aimed ball shot at a relatively soft speed, that might not fall if shot with more velocity (""that ball normally wouldn't fall but he hit it at pocket speed"").
2.  Describes the velocity of an object ball shot with just enough speed to reach the intended pocket and drop.
""Shoot this with pocket speed only, so you don't send the cue ball too far up-table.""
A tactic employed in UK eight-ball pool in which a player calls and pots one of the balls in a favorably lying set, then plays safe, leaving as many of their well-placed balls on the table as possible, until the opponents commits a foul or leaves a chance that the player feels warrants an attempt at running out.
A British term for someone with little experience or understanding of the game, who may be skilled at potting individual balls but does not consider tactics such as position or safety; ""he's a potter, not a player."" Compare U.S. banger.
Erring too much in this direction is ""missing on the professional side of the pocket."" It is so called because experienced players understand that on a thin cut, overcutting the object ball to a corner pocket will far more often leave the object ball in an unfavorable position, i.e. along the short rail for the incoming opponent than will an undercut, which often leaves the object ball sitting in front of or nearby the pocket it had been intended for on a miss.
By contrast, in eight-ball, except when both players are shooting at the 8 ball, the incoming player after a miss is shooting for different object balls, so this maxim does not apply, and the opposite may be good strategy as, if the object ball stays near the pocket through an undercut, it is advantageously positioned for a subsequent turn and may block the opponent's use of the pocket.
A rule in many games (most notably nine-ball, after and only after the break shot), allowing a player to ""push out"" the cue ball to a new position without having to contact any ball, much less pocket one or drive it to a cushion, but not counting any pocketed ball as valid (other foul rules apply, such as double hits, scratching the cue ball, etc.), with the caveat that the opponent may shoot from the new cue ball position or give the shot back to the pusher who must shoot from the new position.
In nine-ball particularly, and derived games such as seven-ball and ten-ball, pocketing the money ball on a push-out results in that ball being respotted (which can be used to strategic advantage in certain circumstances, such as when the break leaves no shot on the ball-on, and failure to hit it would give the incoming player an instant-win combination shot on the money ball).
Any foul shot in which a player's cue tip stays in contact with the cue ball for more than the momentary time commensurate with a stroked shot.
In the game of snooker, it is considered a push if the cue strikes the cue ball more than once in a given shot (a double hit) or if the cue stick, cue ball, and ball-on are all in contact together during a shot (if the cue ball and object ball began frozen together, the player must shoot away from that object ball without moving it and the touching ball rule applies).
1.  The full fifteen ball set of pool or snooker object balls after being racked, before the break shot (i.e., same as rack, definition 2, and triangle, defn.
The act of setting up the balls for a break shot.
Chiefly American: In pool games, when a player racks the object balls, and the breaking opponent does not pocket a ball on the break, and the person who racked the game commences to run out all of the remaining object balls without the breaker getting another visit at the table.
3.  In carom billiards, the object ball that is neither player's cue ball.
Other duties of the referee include racking each frame, re-spotting balls during the course of a game, maintaining the equipment associated with the table (e.g. keeping the balls clean), controlling the crowd and, if necessary, controlling the players.
2.  In pool, placing of the object balls back in the rack, after a foul break.
In snooker, a situation where the scores are tied after all the balls have been potted, and the black ball is re-spotted and the first player to pot it wins.
The players toss for the first shot, which must be taken with the cue ball in the D.
3.  A nine-ball ring game is played by more than two players and has special rules.
A pool table spread in which the balls are extremely easily positioned for a run out, and where little movement of the cue ball on each shot is necessary to obtain position on the next.
Their weight has a strong effect on play, as they are difficult to draw (screw), stop and stun, and generate a large amount of smash-through, compared to standard and magnetic cue balls, but do not reduce cut shot accuracy like grapefruit balls.
It is most common in the game of snooker, and is often results in a foul in many pool games, where after the cue ball has contacted a legal object ball either any ball must contact a cushion or any object ball must be pocketed.
A roll-up can be legal in such games when the object ball used for the tactic is very close to a cushion, so that either it or the cue ball lightly touch the cushion after ball-on-ball contact.
The term actually derives from the set-up of the game Chicago, in which the balls are not racked, but placed numerically around the table along the cushions (and must be shot in ascending order).
Describing a shot that requires one or more balls to be played off several cushions, such as an elaborate escape or a positional shot; ""he'll have to send the cue ball round the angles to get good position.""
The number of balls pocketed in an inning in pool (e.g., a run of five balls), or points scored in a row in carom billiards (e.g., a run of five points).
In English billiards, running a coup is when a player, from ball in hand, directly pockets the cue-ball when no ball(s) are out of baulk.
2.  A shot that is called aloud as part of a game's rules; once invoked, a safety usually allows the player to pocket their own object ball without having to shoot again, for strategic purposes.
A form of doubles (pairs) play in which the two team members take turns, playing alternating shots during an inning (i.e., each team's inning consists of two players' alternating visits, each of one shot only, until that team's inning ends, and the next team begins their alternating-shot turn, or the frame ends.) Effective scotch doubles play requires close rapport between team partners, especially as to advantageous cue ball position for the incoming player; whether the pair may directly communicate with each other during their inning varies by rule set.
A wall-mounted, usually wooden rack with several numbered shelves to hold each player's pocketed balls, used for keeping score between players of games in which points are awarded by the numerical values on the balls.
Pocketing of the cue ball, in pool games.
To be able to clearly see a path to a pocket or object ball without any other obstacle interfering, usually as a straight shot: ""The 3 ball is hanging in the pocket, but I can't see it because the 9 ball is in my way.""
A moderate curve imparted to the path of the cue ball by an elevated hit with use of english (side); or a shot using this technique.
1.  (Of a player or referee) to place the balls (and other items, if applicable, such as skittles) properly for the beginning of a game: ""In eight-ball, properly setting up requires that the rear corners of the rack not have two stripes or two solids but one of each."" For most games this is in a racked pattern, but the term is applicable more broadly than ""rack"", e.g. in carom billiards and in games like bottle pool.
4.  (Of a player, passively, generally, and chiefly US) to be in a favorable position for, and with a layout conductive to, a long run (UK: break) or complete run-out: ""a crucial miss that left their opponent really set-up""; compare (chiefly British) ""in the balls""
5.  (Of a player, actively) to use position play to move one or more specific balls to specific locations with a specific goal in mind, usually pocketing (potting) a specific ball or getting an easy out, but possibly a safety, nurse or trap shot; in short, to get shape: ""She set up on the 9-ball with a careful draw shot."" The meaning can be inverted to indicate poor play on the part of the other player: ""Oops, I just set you up for an easy win when I missed like that.""
7.  (Of cue ball position more specifically): having good shape – comparatively easy to use to some advantage, such as continuing a run (UK: break) or playing safe: ""The cue ball's set up for an easy side pocket shot.""
An additional difference from nine-ball-style rules is that the 7 must be pocketed in a specific side of the table (each player being assigned one at the beginning of the game).
A pocket; usually used in disgust when describing a scratch (e.g., ""the cue ball's gone down the sewer"").
When playing a shot, the two rails nearest to the pocket on a standard pool, billiards or snooker table.
The use of the cue to perform or attempt to perform a particular motion of balls on the table, such as to pocket (pot) an object ball, to achieve a successful carom (cannon), or to play a safety.
Spin placed on the cue ball when hit with the cue tip to the left or right of the ball's center; usually called english in American usage.
The effect of shooting regulation-weight object balls with an old-fashioned over-weight bar table cue ball, such that the cue ball moves forward to occupy (sometimes only temporarily), or go beyond, the original position of the object ball, even on a draw or stop shot, because the mass of the cue ball exceeds that of the object ball.
Smash-through also makes it dangerous in bar pool (when equipped with such a cue ball) to pocket straight-on ducks with a stop shot instead of by cheating the pocket because of the likelihood of scratching the cue ball.
A British term for a pot that requires very fine contact between cue ball and object ball.
2.  (verb) To leave the opponent (accidentally or by means of a safety) so that a certain shot on a preferred object ball cannot be played directly in a straight line by normal cueing.
It can also refer to the potting angle or another significant point of contact on the object ball, blocking an otherwise more straightforward shot, even if an edge can be seen.
The use of the correct amount of cue ball speed in position play to achieve proper shape for a subsequent shot.
In pool, a type of shot in which two object balls are initially contacted by the cue ball simultaneously or so close to simultaneously as for the difference to be indistinguishable to the eye.
In most sets of rules it is a foul if the split is one in which one of the object balls is a (or the only) legal target (ball-on) and the other is not; however, such a split is commonly considered a legal shot in informal bar pool in many areas if it is called as a split and does appear to strike the balls simultaneously).
2.  In pool, the degree to which racked balls move apart upon impact by the cue ball as a result of a break shot.
3.  In snooker, a shot sending the cue ball into the pack of red balls and separating them (after potting the ball-on).
2.  spot, a: In snooker, any of the six designated points on the table on which a colour ball is replaced after it has left the playing surface (usually after it has been potted).
In carom billiards and English billiards, the second player's cue ball, which for the shooting player is another object ball along with the red.
Contrast the white ball, the starting player's cue ball.
1.  In pool, return an illegally pocketed object ball to the table by placement on the foot spot or as near to it as possible without moving other balls (in ways that may differ from ruleset to ruleset).
5.  In some variants of pool, to place the cue ball on the head spot or as near to it as possible inside the kitchen/baulk, after the opponent has scratched.
The situation arising in many pool games where a ball is spotted to the table's foot spot or some other specific location and the cue ball must be shot from the kitchen or the ""D"".
There are diamond system aiming techniques for pocketing such shots without scratching the cue ball into a pocket.
A form of nurse shot in English billiards, in which the red ball – which must be spotted to a specific location after each time it is potted, prior to the next shot being taken – is potted in such a way as to leave the cue ball in position to repeat the same shot, permitting a skilled player to rack up many points in a single break of these shots in one visit.
Any shot in which the cue ball or an object ball has to squeeze by (just miss with almost no margin for error) another ball or balls in order to reach its intended target.
In the UK, a long-distance shot played to pot a ball close to a pocket with heavy top spin, so that when the cue ball hits the cushion it bounces off but then stops due to the counteraction of the spin.
Any shot where the cue ball stops immediately after hitting an object ball.
A shot played with stun, but not quite enough to completely stop the cue ball, allowing for a little follow.
A shot where the cue ball has no top spin or back spin on it when it impacts an object ball, and ""stuns"" out along the tangent line.
A player skilled at very thin cut shots, and shots in which a ball must pass cleanly through a very narrow space (such as the cue ball between two of the opponent's object balls with barely enough room) to avoid a foul and/or to pocket a ball.
However, in some variants of bar pool a table scratch while shooting for the 8 ball is a loss of game where other more minor fouls might not be, as is scratching on the 8 ball (neither result in a loss of game in professional and most amateur league rules).
2.  By way of drift from the above definition, the term is also applied by many league players to the foul in more standardized rules of failing to drive a (any) ball to a cushion, or to pocket a legal object ball, after the cue ball's initial contact with an object ball.
Fast cloth can make draw (screw) shots somewhat less effective, as there is less purchase for the cue ball's back spin.
It is played by most of the same rules as nine-ball (especially that the lowest-numbered object ball remaining on the table must always be struck first by the cue ball), but differs (in the WPA standardized rules) in that shots must be called.
An amateur multi-player (and often gambling) game, played with three object balls, racked either in a triangle or a straight line toward the end rail from the foot spot.
The game is played by each player trying to pocket all three balls (the same player remaining at the table until this is done) in as few shots as possible and without incurring any fouls.
Luck plays a more significant role in this game than usual, due to the possibility of pocketing two or even all three balls on the break shot.
In nine-ball and straight pool, a player must be the told they are on two fouls in order to transgress the rule, and if violated, results in a loss of game for in former, and a special point penalty of a loss of fifteen points (plus one for the foul itself) in the latter together with the ability to require the violator to rerack and rebreak.
While throw is most easily observed between the cue ball and an object ball, it also happens between two or more object balls, which is one of the factors that makes combination shots challenging.
Skilled players thus often shoot cut shots with a small amount of outside english – gearing outside English – to neutralize the cut-induced throw that widens the shot away from the tangent line, though other techniques may be required instead or in combination with that, depending on the desired cue-ball position at the end of the shot.
A shot in which the cue ball is driven first to one or more rails, then hits an object ball and kisses back to the last rail contacted.
Any shot in which the cue ball moves another ball to a different position and then rebounds off one or more rails to contact the object ball again (normally in an attempt to pocket it or score a billiard).
1.  Chiefly British: The half of the table in which the object balls are racked (in games that use racked balls).
A term used in snooker for the potting of all the balls that are racked at the beginning of the frame in a single break (run).
The player must call ""total snooker"" to the referee, which allows a dispensation to the player from having to hit a cushion after contacting the object ball, which is otherwise a foul.
In snooker, the situation in which the cue ball is resting in contact with an object ball.
2.  The object balls in triangular formation, before the break shot, after being racked as above (i.e., same as rack, definition 2).
An exhibition shot designed to impress either by a player's skill or knowledge of how to set the balls up and take advantage of the angles of the table; usually a combination of both.
A British term for a type of bank shot in which the object ball is potted off two cushions, especially by sending it twice across the table and into a side pocket.
A rule in blackball whereby after an opponent has faulted and thus yielded two shots, if the incoming shooter pots a ball on the first shot, (s)he is still allowed to miss in a later shot and take a second shot in-hand (from the ""D"" or from baulk, or if the opponent potted the cue ball, from anywhere)—even on the black, in most variants.
Many local rules state the in-hand from the D (see D, the) or baulk (or if the opponent potted the cue ball, from anywhere) nature of the second shot is lost if a ball is potted on the first shot, that it is lost if the ball potted in the first shot was that player's last coloured ball (object ball in their group), and/or that there is only ever one shot on the black after a fault.
A three cushion billiards shot in which the cue ball first strikes two cushions before hitting the first object ball then hits a third cushion before hitting the second object ball.
Umbrella shots may be classified as inside or outside depending on which side of the first object ball the cue ball contacts.
A British term describing when a ball is tight on the cushion and a player sends the cue ball to hit both the object ball and the rail at nearly the same time; the object ball, ideally, stays tight to the rail and is thus ""velcroed"" to the rail.
An object ball positioned near a pocket so that another object ball shot at that pocket will likely go in off the warrior, even if aimed so imperfectly that if the warrior had been absent, the shot likely would have missed.
2.  In games where multiple balls must be pocketed in succession to score a specific number of points, such as cribbage pool, when the last ball necessary to score has been potted, the points total given is referred to as a ""way"".
2.  In carom billiards games and English billiards, a more specific term for the starting opponent's cue ball, which for the shooting player is another object ball along with the red.
Contrast spot ball, the other player's cue ball.
Shooting at an object ball that is already in motion (""on the wing"") at the moment of shooting and cue ball impact; it is a foul in most games, and usually only seen in trick shots and in speed pool.
A shot in which the cue ball is used to pot another ball.
In snooker and most pool games doing this is known as potting, pocketing or sinking the targeted ball.
Whether the ball is an object ball or an opponent's cue ball depends upon the type of game (some have two cue balls).
The move will score points in most (but not all) games in which hazards (as such) apply, such as English billiards (in which a ""red winner"" is the potting of the red ball and a ""white winner"" the potting of the opponent's cue ball, each worth a different number of points).
The spot (usually not specially marked because it is obvious) on a snooker table at which the yellow ball is placed."

1 ball 
2 ball 
3 ball 
4 ball 
5 ball 
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining five object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 6.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining six object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 7.
(Pocketing the 8 early is a loss of game—unless done on the break shot, in most rules variants.) In other games, such as nine-ball and straight pool, the 8 is simply another object ball.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining eight object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 9.
It is the last ball that must be pocketed, after the remaining nine object balls have been pocketed, or may be pocketed early to win the game so long as the lowest-numbered ball on the table is struck before the 10, and the 10 ball and pocket are called.
Used in snooker in reference to the position of the cue ball.
In snooker and pool, a cue ball situated in the jaws of a pocket such that a/the ball-on cannot be struck directly.
The ball placed at the front of a group of racked object balls (i.e., toward the breaker and furthest from the racker), and in most games situated over the table's foot spot.
In carom games, a shot in which in attempting to score, the cue ball contacts three or more cushions, usually including both short rails.
Used in snooker to describe the path that the cue ball must take into and out of baulk as a result of poor position play, specifically coming around the baulk colours off three or more cushions, normally on a shot on the blue to finish on a red as a result of finishing low on the blue.
A cut shot in which if a line were drawn from the cue ball to the rail behind the targeted object ball, perpendicular to that rail, the object ball would lie beyond the line with respect to the pocket being targeted.
This balk is where the cue ball is placed in lagging for lead, for making the opening break shot, and sometimes for other purposes, depending upon the game.
In the eponymous balkline billiards there are four balklines, drawn parallel to and typically 14 or 18 inches from the cushions of the table, dividing it into nine compartments or divisions, of which the outside eight are the balks, in which only a set number of caroms may be scored before at least one ball must leave the area.
The option of placing the cue ball anywhere on the table prior to shooting, in a game of pool.
A common variation, used in games such as straight pool and often in bar pool, is ball-in-hand ""behind the head string"", also ""behind the line"" or ""from the kitchen"", meaning the ball-in-hand option is restricted to placement anywhere behind the head string, i.e., in the area of the table known as the kitchen.
Coin-operated bar tables have ball-return mechanisms that separate the cue ball from the object balls so that the object balls are captured when pocketed until the game ends, then released when paid for again, while the cue ball is continually returned for continued play after scratches.
There are tables that use optical sensors to distinguish a standard cue ball from object balls.
Some of them are also setup to return the 8 ball as well, so that pocketing it on the break does not end the game.
Shot in which an object ball is driven to one or more rails prior to being pocketed (or in some contexts, prior to reaching its intended target; not necessarily a pocket).
A rule variant common in bar pool versions of eight-ball, in which the 8-ball must be pocketed on a bank shot (generally this would either be accomplished via a bank shot proper or a kick shot); shooting the 8 straight in is a loss of game.
Pool, almost always a variant of eight-ball, that is played by bar players on a bar table.
Typical differences between bar pool and tournament eight-ball are the lack of ball-in-hand after a foul, the elimination of a number of fouls, and (with numbered ball sets) the requirement that most aspects of a shot be called (including cushions and other object balls to be contacted) not just the target ball and pocket.
Another distinguishing factor is the cue ball; these tables capture pocketed object balls to remove them from play, but selectively return a scratched cue ball.
Used in snooker in reference to the position of the cue ball.
A pool and occasionally snooker term (inherited from carom billiards by way of ""big ball"", above), it is a metaphor for a shot that is very difficult to miss pocketing for any of a number of reasons, most commonly: either the object ball is positioned such that a near miss on one side of it will likely cause the cue ball to rebound off the rail into the object ball and pocket it anyway; or another ball is positioned such that if the target ball does not go straight in, it is still likely to go in off the other ball in a kiss.
1.  Any shot in which the cue ball is caromed off an object ball to strike another object ball (with or without contacting cushions in the interim).
2.  In certain carom billiards games such as three-cushion, a successful attempt at making a scoring billiard shot under the rules for that game (such as contacting three cushions with the cue ball while executing the billiard).
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the black ball is placed.
1.  In snooker, the colour ball worth five points, placed on the blue spot in the centre of the table.
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the blue ball is placed.
The bottle used in various games to hold numbered peas, it is employed to assign random spots to players in a roster (such as in a tournament), or to assign random balls to players of a game (such as in kelly pool and bottle pool).
In carom games it describes the first point attempt, as shot from an unvarying cue ball and object balls placement; in many pool games it describes the first shot, which is used to separate the object balls that have been racked together;
Chiefly American: In pool games, when a player breaks the racked object balls, pockets at least one ball on the break, and commences to run out the remaining object balls without the opponent getting a visit at the table.
In straight pool, the last object ball left on a table before the remaining fourteen balls must be racked so the player at the table may continue their run.
It is called the ""break ball"" because it is common for players to try to leave this ball in such a position that they may easily pot it and billiard off of it to break open the rack of fourteen balls and continue their run.
In European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF) nine-ball, the break box is a zone in the ""kitchen"" of the head (British: bottom) of the table, from which the break shot must be taken with the cue ball.
This departure from WPA World Standardised Rules defeats the common break-from-the-side-rail technique for pocketing the 9 ball to win the game on the break; while 9 ball breaks are still possible, they are much more difficult under this rule.
The spot (often not marked) on a snooker table at which the brown ball is placed.
For example, in straight pool a player must call the pocket in which a ball is intended to be potted.
Applies specifically to games that enforce ""call-pocket/call-safe"" rules, which require the player to either call the ball and pocket, or call a safety on every shot.
After a legal shot, where a called ball is not pocketed as designated, the incoming player has the option to pass the shot back to the player who missed the called shot.
A call-shot/call-safe nine-ball example: Player A calls the ball-on, the 3 ball in this case, in the corner pocket but misses the shot.
The cue ball rolls down table and comes to rest behind the 5 ball leaving no clear path to the 3 ball for the incoming player B.
Describes any game in which during normal play a player must call the ball to be hit and the intended pocket; ""eight-ball is a call-shot game."" Sometimes referred to as ""call[ed]-pocket"", ""ball-and-pocket rules"", etc., to distinguish it from the common North American bar pool practice of requiring every aspect of shots to be called, such as caroms, kicks, and cushions to be contacted (this is sometimes also ambiguously referred to as ""call-shot"", but more accurately termed ""call-everything"" or ""call-it-all"").
Commonly in bar rules terminology, call-shot indicates how the shot will be made as compared to call-pocket which means simply that the ball must go into that pocket, details unnecessary.
The ball designated by a player to be pocketed on a shot.
The pocket designated by a player to which a ball is to be shot.
1.  The red object ball in carom billiards games.
1.  Carom came into use in the 1860s and is a shortening of carambola, which was earlier used to describe the red object ball used in many billiards games.
2.  More specifically, short for a carom shot, a cannon in British terminology, in which a point is scored in carom billiards games by careening the cue ball into the two object balls.
3.  In pocket games as a general class, carom or carom shot is sometimes used more loosely, between the above two definitions, to refer to clipping an object ball with the cue ball to attempt to send either or both to desirable locations, not necessarily scoring in the process.
In games in which pocketing the cue ball is a goal (e.g. Russian pyramid), carom can refer to sending the cue ball into a pocket after contacting an object ball (called a losing hazard in English billiards, it nevertheless scores points; but it is a foul in snooker, called an in-off, and in pool, called a scratch).
It is played on a table without pockets, and scoring is generally done by driving a cue ball into contact with one object ball, then having the cue ball contact one or more cushions before contacting another object ball; however, there are numerous variations, some of which involve additional objects, such as upright pins as targets or hazards.
In snooker, English billiards and other British usage, a break of 100 points or more, which requires potting at least 25 balls consecutively, in snooker, but can be earned via a combination of scoring techniques in English billiards, etc.
Cheating the pocket is employed for position play, to allow a ball to pass another partially obscuring the path to the pocket, and to prevent scratches on dead-straight shots in cases where draw is not desirable (or may not be dependable, e.g. because of distance from the pocket or smash-through).
A situation where the cue ball is directly in front of another ball in the line of the shot such that the player is hampered by it, having to bridge over it awkwardly with the likelihood of a foul looming if the object ball is inadvertently touched.
To play a shot with the stroke and speed that makes it easiest to pocket the object ball, even at the expense of sacrificing position.
To maneuver a ball on a shot so that it will be favorably positioned for later play into a particular pocket, even at the expense of sacrificing position or the inning to achieve that result.
Describing a shot in bar pool: the pocketing of an object ball in a manner such that the target object ball does not kiss any other object ball, and is not banked, kicked, caromed, or combo'd in, and without double-kissing, though it may hit the knuckles, and depending upon local bar-rules may be allowed to contact either of the cushions, not just at the knuckle, that run into the target pocket.
E.g., in a game of nine-ball, if the 1 and the 7 were clustered together along a cushion with the 9 behind them near a pocket, and the cue ball could strike the 1 full face with a result of the 1 heading off the 7 toward the top rail and the 7 rebounding quickly across the table from the cushion, the cue ball, with top spin could retain enough post-impact momentum to continue forward and pocket the 9 as long as both the 1 and the 7 were cleared out the way first.
In a game like eight-ball, a clearance shot might also be used at the end of an inning to move some problem balls that are blocking an otherwise easy run, and leave the cue ball in a safe position, in hopes of having a better layout to work with in the next inning.
Tickie shots are among the most common clearance approaches, especially for very short distances of intended cue ball travel past the initial contact.
A typical precaution against cling is to ask for the cue ball and/or object ball to be cleaned by the referee in order to remove chalk that is already on the ball prior to the shot; and (including in non-refereed games) players cleaning the cue ball personally after gaining ball-in-hand.
Side spin imparted to an object ball by the friction from the hit of the cue ball during a cut shot.
Any shot in which the cue ball contacts an object ball, which in turn hits one or more additional object balls (which in turn may hit yet further object balls) to send the last-hit object ball to an intended place, usually a pocket.
In snooker, when a player offers the frame to their opponent, even though balls remain on the table.
When the corner lip of a pocket blocks the path of the cue ball from contacting an intended object ball.
A type of nurse shot used in English billiards in which two coloured balls are positioned on either side of the mouth of a snooker table pocket but not touching and, thus placed, can be successively contacted and scored off over and over by the cue ball without moving them.
A British term describing a bank shot in which the cue ball crosses the future path of the object ball.
It is widely thought that better snooker players get lower to the table with their chins on the cue, have a straight back leg, their elbow hinging in line with the shot, and a straight follow-through after the cue ball has been struck.
cue ball 
A chiefly British term describing the amount of control a player can retain when playing shots with heavy spin and great pace; ""it took tremendous cue power to get onto the 2 ball having been relatively straight on the 1"".
The most common form of dead arrangements are the dead combination or dead combo (a combination shot in which contact with the first object ball will pocket another one), and the dead kiss, in which contact with the first object ball will pocket it off of another one.
Even cut shot angles may be affected because of the cling or skid (British: kick) effect, and professional players often ask a referee to clean a ball, mid-game.
dead ball shot 
1.  A cue sports game (such as eight-ball, three-cushion billiards, 18.2 balkline, etc.), especially as a professional or serious amateur specialization: ""He was a World Champion in three billiards disciplines.""
An illegal shot (foul) in which the cue stick's tip contacts the cue ball twice during a single stroke.
Double hits often occur when a player shoots the cue ball when it is very close to an object ball or cushion, because it is difficult to move the cue stick away quickly enough after the cue ball rebounds off the cushion or object ball.
A carom billiards shot, common in three-cushion billiards, where the cue ball is shot with reverse english at a relatively shallow angle down the rail, and spins backwards off the adjacent rail back into the first rail.
To intentionally rebound the cue ball off both of the pocket points to achieve position.
A shot played slowly and with heavy draw and follow-through so that the cue ball can be struck firmly but with a lot of the pace taken out, allowing more control than just a gentle tap that would travel as far.
Back spin slows the cue ball down, reduces its travel, and narrows both the carom angle after contact with an object ball, and angle of reflection off a cushion.
A shot in which the cue ball is struck below its equator with sufficient draw to make it reverse direction at the moment of contact with an object ball because it is still back-spinning.
When the object and cue balls are lined up square, the reversal will be directly backwards, while on a cut shot, the effect will alter the carom angle.
A break shot in pool on which zero object balls are potted.
A type of containing safety shot in snooker where the cue ball is played slowly up the table in order to ""dump"" it on the (usually) top cushion and leave the object ball safe.
They have in common the use of a rack of fifteen object balls and a single cue ball, a hard break from behind the head string or baulk line, and a goal of pocketing (potting) all of one's own suit of balls then finally the black 8 ball.
Ball-and-pocket are called for each shot, with fouls (faults) resulting in cue ball in-hand for the opponent, anywhere on the table.
Chiefly American: Also known as side spin, english (which is usually not capitalized) is spin placed on the cue ball when hit with the cue tip to the left or right of the ball's center.
English has a marked effect on cue ball rebound angle off cushions (though not off object balls), and is thus crucial for gaining shape; it can also be used to ""throw"" an object ball slightly off its otherwise expected trajectory, to cheat the pocket, and for other effects.
Pool facings are flat and angled rather wide, on pockets notably larger than the balls, to act much like the backboard in basketball, in that a shot can be directed into the facing to cause it to angle off the facing into the pocket.
Snooker facings are curved and not angled, providing a smooth transition between the rails and the pockets, which are not much wider than the balls, thus preventing any backboard effect (snooker shots must be almost perfectly straight in).
A very thin cut shot in which the cue ball just brushes the edge of an object ball.
Examples of flukes include an unexpected pot off several cushions or other balls having missed the pocket aimed for, or a lucky safety position after having missed a shot.
In many games, flukes result in a loss of turn, although some rule sets (most notably those of snooker, nine-ball and related games, and the eight-ball rules of the American Poolplayers Association and its affiliates) count flukes as valid, point-making shots.
The forward rotation of the cue ball that results from a follow shot.
A shot in which the cue ball is struck above its equator with sufficient top spin to cause the cue ball to travel forward after it contacts an object ball.
By contrast, on a cut shot, a cue ball with follow on it will first travel on the tangent line after striking the object ball, and then arc forward, widening the carom angle.
On a shot, the extension of the cue stick through the cue ball position during the end of a player's stroke in the direction originally aimed.
Chiefly American: The half of the table in which the object balls are racked (in games in which racked balls are used).
The point on the table surface over which the apex ball of a rack is centered (in most games).
A powerful follow shot with a high degree of top spin on it; usually when the object ball being hit is relatively close to the cue ball and is being hit very full; also known as ""prograde top spin"" or ""prograde follow"" (when referring to the action on the shot rather than the shot per se), and as a ""jenny"" in Australia.
Sometimes interchangeable with scratch, though the latter is often used only to refer to the foul of pocketing the cue ball.
In many pool games the penalty for a foul is ball-in-hand anywhere on the table for the opponent.
In one-pocket, in which a set number of balls must be made in a specific pocket, upon a foul the player must return a ball to the table.
In UK eight-ball this would normally give the opponent the option of one of two plays: (1) ball-in-hand with two shots; (2) being allowed to contact, or even pot, a ball other than one from their set from the snookered position (although the black may not be potted), with the loss of the first shot.
In addition, some variations of the game allow the player to pot one of the opposition's balls, on the first visit only, without the loss of a ""free shot"".
In snooker, it allows a player to call any ball as the ball they would have wanted to play, potting it for the same number of points, or the opponent can be put back in without the same privilege, having to play the ball snookered on.
In snooker (and some British pool rules), this is called a touching ball, and the cue ball must be shot away from the object ball without the latter moving.
It is commonly used in reference to how much of an object ball a player can see with the cue ball: ""Can you hit that full?"".
Nine-ball is a game.
game ball 
In the carom games, any shot where the end result is all the balls near each other; ideally, in position for the start of a nurse on the next stroke.
A common aiming method in which a phantom ball is imagined frozen to the object ball at the point where an imaginary line drawn between their centers is aimed at the desired target; the center of cue ball may then be shot at the center of the ""ghost"" ball (i.e., to precisely take the place of where that ball is imagined to be) and, ideally, impact the object ball at the proper contact point.
In nine-ball a break shot that pots the 9 ball without fouling, in which case the player wins in one shot.
1.  Nearly table-length distance between the cue ball and target object ball, or between an object ball and target pocket, i.e. a potentially difficult shot due to distance (""you sure left me a lot of green on that one"")
The spot (usually not specially marked because it is obvious) on a snooker table at which the green ball is placed.
A shot aimed so that the center of the cue ball is in line with the edge of the object ball, eclipsing half of the ball.
In snooker and other British usages, a break of between 50 and 99 points (100 points or more being called a century), which requires potting at least 12 consecutive balls (e.g. the last three reds with at least two blacks and a pink, followed by all the colours).
A ball hanging in the pocket – a ""hanger"" – is nearly unmissable (though fouling by scratching the cue ball into the pocket right after the object ball is a common mistake).
1.  An easily shot object ball that is ""hanging"" in the pocket.
1.  Literally, a pocket, but generally used in the phrases losing hazard – potting (pocketing) the cue ball off another ball – and winning hazard – using the cue ball to pot another ball – the two types of legal shots that pocket balls in games in which the term is used at all, which is very few today.
In most pool games, the opening break shot must be performed with the center (base) of the cue ball behind the head string (i.e. between the head string and head rail).
In snooker, to leave the cue ball ball on the spot of a colour ball after potting it.
This occurs at the start of a frame, and after the cue ball has been potted or forced off the table.
A player's (or doubles team's) turn at the table, usually ending with a failure to score a point or to pocket a ball, depending on the game, a foul, a safety or with a win.
(Chiefly British.) In snooker, English billiards, and blackball/eight-ball pool, an instance where the cue ball has been potted (pocketed) after contacting an object ball.
(Chiefly British.) In a snookers required situation in snooker, a shot played by the player defending the lead, where they play the object ball in such a way as to try to slowly pot (pocket) it, so that if it misses, at least it is over the pocket and difficult to obtain the required snooker from.
(Chiefly British) Said of an object ball that can easily be reached by the cue ball, or of a pocket that can easily be reached by a selected object ball, usually directly (i.e. without intervening kick, bank, carom, kiss or combination shots).
A ball that is easily made from many positions on the table but which is left untouched while the rack is played, so that in the event the player gets out of position, the shooter has an insurance shot.
In snooker, a phrase used to describe a situation where the player has an easy pot and in general the balls are in a position to go on to make a sizeable break.
When a particular ball is given as a handicap in nine-ball, designating that ball in turn means that it must be made in rotation, when it is the lowest numerical ball remaining on the table, and cannot be made to garner a win earlier in the game by way of a combination, carom or any other shot.
For example, if a player is spotted the 8 ball, they only win by making that ball after balls 1 through 7 have been cleared from the table.
Any shot where the cue ball is intentionally jumped into the air to clear an obstacle (usually an object ball, even in games with non-ball objects, e.g. bottle pool).
Jump shots must be performed by hitting the cue ball into the table's surface so that it rebounds off the cloth; scooping under the cue ball to fling it into the air is deemed a foul by all authoritative rules sources.
1.  A shot or ball that allows a player to obtain shape on another ball hard to play position to.
3.  The 14th object ball in a rack of straight pool that, when proper position is achieved on, allows easy position play, in turn, on the last (15th) object ball for an intergame break shot.
Because of the comparatively light weight of snooker balls, and much smaller margins of error due to tight pocket sizes on a very large table, the throw effect of a kick can cause a seemingly easy snooker shot to miss widely.
Even if the kick was mostly vertical, due to screw (bottom spin) or follow (top spin) rather than side spin, and the shot was potted, a kick often results in balls visibly jumping upon impact, resulting in a great loss of cue ball momentum, which can wreck the shot's position play and leave the player with poor options.
A shot in which the cue ball is driven to one or more rail or cushions before reaching its intended target—usually an object ball.
A shot intended to slow down or ""kill"" the cue ball's speed as much as possible after contact with an object ball; usually a shot with draw, often combined with inside english.
If the player's intention was to cause two object balls to kiss (e.g. to pocket a shot ball by ricocheting it off a stationary one), it is often called a kiss shot.
A shot in which the object is to pocket (pot) an object ball by striking it with the cue ball and then having the object ball ricochet off another object ball into a pocket.
The knuckles are protrusive and comparatively sharp on a pool table, the facings of which can be used like a basketball backboard to rebound a ball into a pocket.
To determine the order of play, players (representing only themselves, or sometimes teams) each near simultaneously shoot a ball from the kitchen (or in British games, from the baulk line) to the end rail and back toward the bottom rail.
A common rule in informal bar pool, especially bar/pub eight-ball, in which the money ball must be pocketed (potted) in the same pocket as the shooter's last object ball (each player may be said to eventually ""own"" a pocket, for the duration of the game, in which their 8 ball shot must be played if they have already run out their suit).
The variant is not extremely common in the United States or the UK, but is near-universal in much of Latin America (where two cue ball scratches are permitted when attempting the 8 ball shot and count as simple fouls, with only a third scratch constituting a loss of game).
Last-pocket rules require careful position play, and frequently result in bank and kick shots with the 8 ball.
An organization that promotes competitive, usually team, amateur cue sports, most commonly pool, especially eight-ball and nine-ball, although there are also well-established snooker leagues.
The cue ball's position after a shot.
A legal hit is one in which the requirements for a non-foul hit are met (e.g., in nine-ball, the lowest-numbered ball on the table was hit by the cue ball first, and at least one object ball was pocketed, or any ball reached a cushion, after the hit on the first object ball.).
A legal shot is one in which no foul of any kind was involved (e.g. there was not a double hit by the cue, the player's bridge hand did not move a ball, etc.).
A legal stroke is one in which the cue stroke obeyed the rules (e.g. the shooter did not perform an illegal jump shot by scooping under the cue ball with the cue tip).
In snooker, a pot into any of the corner pockets where the cue ball had started in the opposite lengthwise half of the table.
In other words, a pot in which the cue ball or object ball crosses an imaginary line joining the middle pockets.
A shot in which the cue ball is potted after caroming off another ball.
1.  In snooker, a trick shot that involves lining up a number of balls, for example along the baulk line, then, after striking the cue ball toward a corner pocket, hitting the other balls directly with the cue stick into that pocket before the cue ball reaches it.
2.  In pool, a trick shot where a number of object balls are placed in a row to form a line, sometimes near a cushion, or in a line and the cue ball is shot into the balls so as to reverberate between them while traveling and hit each one of the object balls in series, issuing a machine gun-like sound.
Sometimes played intentionally to avoid a double hit when the cue ball is very close to an object ball or cushion.
The miss rule gives the opponent the option to have the referee replace the balls to their original positions and make the player take the shot again.
If a money ball is illegally pocketed, it usually results in a loss of game, or a foul.
In snooker and UK eight-ball especially, this creates the effect of creep in the direction of the nap, the most-affected shot being a slow roll into a center pocket against the nap.
A natural bank shot, for example, is one in which simply shooting straight into the object ball at medium speed and with no spin will send the object ball directly into the target pocket on the other side of the table.
3.  In three cushion billiards, the easiest type of shot, in which the second object ball is advantageously placed in a corner.
It is a rotation game, in which the lowest-numbered object ball must be hit first (though balls may be pocketed in any order, such as with a carom shot or combination shot).
The game ends when the 9 ball is legally pocketed, either as the last remaining object ball, or early as long as the lowest-numbered ball was struck first.
A short, jabbed draw stroke usually employed so as to not commit a foul (i.e. due to following through to a double hit) when the cue ball is very near to the target object ball.
In carom billiards games, when all the balls are kept near each other and a cushion so that with very soft shots the balls can be ""nursed"" down a rail, allowing multiple successful shots that effectively replicate the same ball setup so that the nurse shots can be continued almost indefinitely, unless a limit is imposed by the rules.
Excessive use of nurse shots in straight rail by players skilled enough to set them up and pull them off repeatedly at will is what led to the development of the balkline and one-cushion game variations, and repetitive shot limitation rules in English billiards.
1.  pool: See Having the cue ball on a string.
As a result of the opening break shot (the ""snap""), usually said of winning by pocketing the money ball (""won on the snap"", ""got it on the snap"", etc.) Employed most commonly in the game of nine-ball where pocketing the 9 ball at any time in the game on a legal stroke, including the break shot, is a win.
One of the most challenging pool games, in which each player is designated a specific corner pocket on the foot rail, and can only score by pocketing the object balls into it.
A requirement under some pool rulesets that either an object ball be pocketed, or at least four object balls be driven to contact the cushions, on the opening break shot.
A description of play in carom billiards games in which the balls remain widely separated rather than gathered, requiring much more skill to score points and making nurse shots effectively impossible, and making for a more interesting game for onlookers.
To illustrate, the 6-out in a nine-ball game would allow the player getting weight to win by legally pocketing the 6, 7, 8 or 9 balls.
Side spin on a cue ball on the opposite side of the direction of the cut angle to be played (right-hand english when cutting an object ball to the left, and vice versa).
1.  Having the cue ball stop at or near the center of the table on a forceful break shot (the breaking ideal in many games such as nine-ball);
Small, round markers typically numbered 1 through 16, which are placed in a bottle for various random assignment purposes, such as in a tournament roster, to assign order of play in a multiplayer game, or to assign particular balls to players in games such as kelly pool.
The object balls remain nearly stationary, and the player can then play a shot that reverses the striking order of the cue ball against to object balls.
The marked spot on a snooker table at which the pink ball is placed.
In snooker, hitting the cue ball in the center, without any spin.
1.  (noun) An opening in a billiards table, cut partly into the bed and partly into the rails and their cushions, into which balls are shot (pocketed or potted).
1.  Describes the propensity of table pockets to more easily accept an imperfectly aimed ball shot at a relatively soft speed, that might not fall if shot with more velocity (""that ball normally wouldn't fall but he hit it at pocket speed"").
2.  Describes the velocity of an object ball shot with just enough speed to reach the intended pocket and drop.
""Shoot this with pocket speed only, so you don't send the cue ball too far up-table.""
A tactic employed in UK eight-ball pool in which a player calls and pots one of the balls in a favorably lying set, then plays safe, leaving as many of their well-placed balls on the table as possible, until the opponents commits a foul or leaves a chance that the player feels warrants an attempt at running out.
A British term for someone with little experience or understanding of the game, who may be skilled at potting individual balls but does not consider tactics such as position or safety; ""he's a potter, not a player."" Compare U.S. banger.
Erring too much in this direction is ""missing on the professional side of the pocket."" It is so called because experienced players understand that on a thin cut, overcutting the object ball to a corner pocket will far more often leave the object ball in an unfavorable position, i.e. along the short rail for the incoming opponent than will an undercut, which often leaves the object ball sitting in front of or nearby the pocket it had been intended for on a miss.
By contrast, in eight-ball, except when both players are shooting at the 8 ball, the incoming player after a miss is shooting for different object balls, so this maxim does not apply, and the opposite may be good strategy as, if the object ball stays near the pocket through an undercut, it is advantageously positioned for a subsequent turn and may block the opponent's use of the pocket.
A rule in many games (most notably nine-ball, after and only after the break shot), allowing a player to ""push out"" the cue ball to a new position without having to contact any ball, much less pocket one or drive it to a cushion, but not counting any pocketed ball as valid (other foul rules apply, such as double hits, scratching the cue ball, etc.), with the caveat that the opponent may shoot from the new cue ball position or give the shot back to the pusher who must shoot from the new position.
In nine-ball particularly, and derived games such as seven-ball and ten-ball, pocketing the money ball on a push-out results in that ball being respotted (which can be used to strategic advantage in certain circumstances, such as when the break leaves no shot on the ball-on, and failure to hit it would give the incoming player an instant-win combination shot on the money ball).
Any foul shot in which a player's cue tip stays in contact with the cue ball for more than the momentary time commensurate with a stroked shot.
In the game of snooker, it is considered a push if the cue strikes the cue ball more than once in a given shot (a double hit) or if the cue stick, cue ball, and ball-on are all in contact together during a shot (if the cue ball and object ball began frozen together, the player must shoot away from that object ball without moving it and the touching ball rule applies).
1.  The full fifteen ball set of pool or snooker object balls after being racked, before the break shot (i.e., same as rack, definition 2, and triangle, defn.
The act of setting up the balls for a break shot.
Chiefly American: In pool games, when a player racks the object balls, and the breaking opponent does not pocket a ball on the break, and the person who racked the game commences to run out all of the remaining object balls without the breaker getting another visit at the table.
3.  In carom billiards, the object ball that is neither player's cue ball.
Other duties of the referee include racking each frame, re-spotting balls during the course of a game, maintaining the equipment associated with the table (e.g. keeping the balls clean), controlling the crowd and, if necessary, controlling the players.
2.  In pool, placing of the object balls back in the rack, after a foul break.
In snooker, a situation where the scores are tied after all the balls have been potted, and the black ball is re-spotted and the first player to pot it wins.
The players toss for the first shot, which must be taken with the cue ball in the D.
3.  A nine-ball ring game is played by more than two players and has special rules.
A pool table spread in which the balls are extremely easily positioned for a run out, and where little movement of the cue ball on each shot is necessary to obtain position on the next.
Their weight has a strong effect on play, as they are difficult to draw (screw), stop and stun, and generate a large amount of smash-through, compared to standard and magnetic cue balls, but do not reduce cut shot accuracy like grapefruit balls.
It is most common in the game of snooker, and is often results in a foul in many pool games, where after the cue ball has contacted a legal object ball either any ball must contact a cushion or any object ball must be pocketed.
A roll-up can be legal in such games when the object ball used for the tactic is very close to a cushion, so that either it or the cue ball lightly touch the cushion after ball-on-ball contact.
The term actually derives from the set-up of the game Chicago, in which the balls are not racked, but placed numerically around the table along the cushions (and must be shot in ascending order).
Describing a shot that requires one or more balls to be played off several cushions, such as an elaborate escape or a positional shot; ""he'll have to send the cue ball round the angles to get good position.""
The number of balls pocketed in an inning in pool (e.g., a run of five balls), or points scored in a row in carom billiards (e.g., a run of five points).
In English billiards, running a coup is when a player, from ball in hand, directly pockets the cue-ball when no ball(s) are out of baulk.
2.  A shot that is called aloud as part of a game's rules; once invoked, a safety usually allows the player to pocket their own object ball without having to shoot again, for strategic purposes.
A form of doubles (pairs) play in which the two team members take turns, playing alternating shots during an inning (i.e., each team's inning consists of two players' alternating visits, each of one shot only, until that team's inning ends, and the next team begins their alternating-shot turn, or the frame ends.) Effective scotch doubles play requires close rapport between team partners, especially as to advantageous cue ball position for the incoming player; whether the pair may directly communicate with each other during their inning varies by rule set.
A wall-mounted, usually wooden rack with several numbered shelves to hold each player's pocketed balls, used for keeping score between players of games in which points are awarded by the numerical values on the balls.
Pocketing of the cue ball, in pool games.
To be able to clearly see a path to a pocket or object ball without any other obstacle interfering, usually as a straight shot: ""The 3 ball is hanging in the pocket, but I can't see it because the 9 ball is in my way.""
A moderate curve imparted to the path of the cue ball by an elevated hit with use of english (side); or a shot using this technique.
1.  (Of a player or referee) to place the balls (and other items, if applicable, such as skittles) properly for the beginning of a game: ""In eight-ball, properly setting up requires that the rear corners of the rack not have two stripes or two solids but one of each."" For most games this is in a racked pattern, but the term is applicable more broadly than ""rack"", e.g. in carom billiards and in games like bottle pool.
4.  (Of a player, passively, generally, and chiefly US) to be in a favorable position for, and with a layout conductive to, a long run (UK: break) or complete run-out: ""a crucial miss that left their opponent really set-up""; compare (chiefly British) ""in the balls""
5.  (Of a player, actively) to use position play to move one or more specific balls to specific locations with a specific goal in mind, usually pocketing (potting) a specific ball or getting an easy out, but possibly a safety, nurse or trap shot; in short, to get shape: ""She set up on the 9-ball with a careful draw shot."" The meaning can be inverted to indicate poor play on the part of the other player: ""Oops, I just set you up for an easy win when I missed like that.""
7.  (Of cue ball position more specifically): having good shape – comparatively easy to use to some advantage, such as continuing a run (UK: break) or playing safe: ""The cue ball's set up for an easy side pocket shot.""
An additional difference from nine-ball-style rules is that the 7 must be pocketed in a specific side of the table (each player being assigned one at the beginning of the game).
A pocket; usually used in disgust when describing a scratch (e.g., ""the cue ball's gone down the sewer"").
When playing a shot, the two rails nearest to the pocket on a standard pool, billiards or snooker table.
The use of the cue to perform or attempt to perform a particular motion of balls on the table, such as to pocket (pot) an object ball, to achieve a successful carom (cannon), or to play a safety.
Spin placed on the cue ball when hit with the cue tip to the left or right of the ball's center; usually called english in American usage.
The effect of shooting regulation-weight object balls with an old-fashioned over-weight bar table cue ball, such that the cue ball moves forward to occupy (sometimes only temporarily), or go beyond, the original position of the object ball, even on a draw or stop shot, because the mass of the cue ball exceeds that of the object ball.
Smash-through also makes it dangerous in bar pool (when equipped with such a cue ball) to pocket straight-on ducks with a stop shot instead of by cheating the pocket because of the likelihood of scratching the cue ball.
A British term for a pot that requires very fine contact between cue ball and object ball.
2.  (verb) To leave the opponent (accidentally or by means of a safety) so that a certain shot on a preferred object ball cannot be played directly in a straight line by normal cueing.
It can also refer to the potting angle or another significant point of contact on the object ball, blocking an otherwise more straightforward shot, even if an edge can be seen.
The use of the correct amount of cue ball speed in position play to achieve proper shape for a subsequent shot.
In pool, a type of shot in which two object balls are initially contacted by the cue ball simultaneously or so close to simultaneously as for the difference to be indistinguishable to the eye.
In most sets of rules it is a foul if the split is one in which one of the object balls is a (or the only) legal target (ball-on) and the other is not; however, such a split is commonly considered a legal shot in informal bar pool in many areas if it is called as a split and does appear to strike the balls simultaneously).
2.  In pool, the degree to which racked balls move apart upon impact by the cue ball as a result of a break shot.
3.  In snooker, a shot sending the cue ball into the pack of red balls and separating them (after potting the ball-on).
2.  spot, a: In snooker, any of the six designated points on the table on which a colour ball is replaced after it has left the playing surface (usually after it has been potted).
In carom billiards and English billiards, the second player's cue ball, which for the shooting player is another object ball along with the red.
Contrast the white ball, the starting player's cue ball.
1.  In pool, return an illegally pocketed object ball to the table by placement on the foot spot or as near to it as possible without moving other balls (in ways that may differ from ruleset to ruleset).
5.  In some variants of pool, to place the cue ball on the head spot or as near to it as possible inside the kitchen/baulk, after the opponent has scratched.
The situation arising in many pool games where a ball is spotted to the table's foot spot or some other specific location and the cue ball must be shot from the kitchen or the ""D"".
There are diamond system aiming techniques for pocketing such shots without scratching the cue ball into a pocket.
A form of nurse shot in English billiards, in which the red ball – which must be spotted to a specific location after each time it is potted, prior to the next shot being taken – is potted in such a way as to leave the cue ball in position to repeat the same shot, permitting a skilled player to rack up many points in a single break of these shots in one visit.
Any shot in which the cue ball or an object ball has to squeeze by (just miss with almost no margin for error) another ball or balls in order to reach its intended target.
In the UK, a long-distance shot played to pot a ball close to a pocket with heavy top spin, so that when the cue ball hits the cushion it bounces off but then stops due to the counteraction of the spin.
Any shot where the cue ball stops immediately after hitting an object ball.
A shot played with stun, but not quite enough to completely stop the cue ball, allowing for a little follow.
A shot where the cue ball has no top spin or back spin on it when it impacts an object ball, and ""stuns"" out along the tangent line.
A player skilled at very thin cut shots, and shots in which a ball must pass cleanly through a very narrow space (such as the cue ball between two of the opponent's object balls with barely enough room) to avoid a foul and/or to pocket a ball.
However, in some variants of bar pool a table scratch while shooting for the 8 ball is a loss of game where other more minor fouls might not be, as is scratching on the 8 ball (neither result in a loss of game in professional and most amateur league rules).
2.  By way of drift from the above definition, the term is also applied by many league players to the foul in more standardized rules of failing to drive a (any) ball to a cushion, or to pocket a legal object ball, after the cue ball's initial contact with an object ball.
Fast cloth can make draw (screw) shots somewhat less effective, as there is less purchase for the cue ball's back spin.
It is played by most of the same rules as nine-ball (especially that the lowest-numbered object ball remaining on the table must always be struck first by the cue ball), but differs (in the WPA standardized rules) in that shots must be called.
An amateur multi-player (and often gambling) game, played with three object balls, racked either in a triangle or a straight line toward the end rail from the foot spot.
The game is played by each player trying to pocket all three balls (the same player remaining at the table until this is done) in as few shots as possible and without incurring any fouls.
Luck plays a more significant role in this game than usual, due to the possibility of pocketing two or even all three balls on the break shot.
In nine-ball and straight pool, a player must be the told they are on two fouls in order to transgress the rule, and if violated, results in a loss of game for in former, and a special point penalty of a loss of fifteen points (plus one for the foul itself) in the latter together with the ability to require the violator to rerack and rebreak.
While throw is most easily observed between the cue ball and an object ball, it also happens between two or more object balls, which is one of the factors that makes combination shots challenging.
Skilled players thus often shoot cut shots with a small amount of outside english – gearing outside English – to neutralize the cut-induced throw that widens the shot away from the tangent line, though other techniques may be required instead or in combination with that, depending on the desired cue-ball position at the end of the shot.
A shot in which the cue ball is driven first to one or more rails, then hits an object ball and kisses back to the last rail contacted.
Any shot in which the cue ball moves another ball to a different position and then rebounds off one or more rails to contact the object ball again (normally in an attempt to pocket it or score a billiard).
1.  Chiefly British: The half of the table in which the object balls are racked (in games that use racked balls).
A term used in snooker for the potting of all the balls that are racked at the beginning of the frame in a single break (run).
The player must call ""total snooker"" to the referee, which allows a dispensation to the player from having to hit a cushion after contacting the object ball, which is otherwise a foul.
In snooker, the situation in which the cue ball is resting in contact with an object ball.
2.  The object balls in triangular formation, before the break shot, after being racked as above (i.e., same as rack, definition 2).
An exhibition shot designed to impress either by a player's skill or knowledge of how to set the balls up and take advantage of the angles of the table; usually a combination of both.
A British term for a type of bank shot in which the object ball is potted off two cushions, especially by sending it twice across the table and into a side pocket.
A rule in blackball whereby after an opponent has faulted and thus yielded two shots, if the incoming shooter pots a ball on the first shot, (s)he is still allowed to miss in a later shot and take a second shot in-hand (from the ""D"" or from baulk, or if the opponent potted the cue ball, from anywhere)—even on the black, in most variants.
Many local rules state the in-hand from the D (see D, the) or baulk (or if the opponent potted the cue ball, from anywhere) nature of the second shot is lost if a ball is potted on the first shot, that it is lost if the ball potted in the first shot was that player's last coloured ball (object ball in their group), and/or that there is only ever one shot on the black after a fault.
A three cushion billiards shot in which the cue ball first strikes two cushions before hitting the first object ball then hits a third cushion before hitting the second object ball.
Umbrella shots may be classified as inside or outside depending on which side of the first object ball the cue ball contacts.
A British term describing when a ball is tight on the cushion and a player sends the cue ball to hit both the object ball and the rail at nearly the same time; the object ball, ideally, stays tight to the rail and is thus ""velcroed"" to the rail.
An object ball positioned near a pocket so that another object ball shot at that pocket will likely go in off the warrior, even if aimed so imperfectly that if the warrior had been absent, the shot likely would have missed.
2.  In games where multiple balls must be pocketed in succession to score a specific number of points, such as cribbage pool, when the last ball necessary to score has been potted, the points total given is referred to as a ""way"".
2.  In carom billiards games and English billiards, a more specific term for the starting opponent's cue ball, which for the shooting player is another object ball along with the red.
Contrast spot ball, the other player's cue ball.
Shooting at an object ball that is already in motion (""on the wing"") at the moment of shooting and cue ball impact; it is a foul in most games, and usually only seen in trick shots and in speed pool.
A shot in which the cue ball is used to pot another ball.
In snooker and most pool games doing this is known as potting, pocketing or sinking the targeted ball.
Whether the ball is an object ball or an opponent's cue ball depends upon the type of game (some have two cue balls).
The move will score points in most (but not all) games in which hazards (as such) apply, such as English billiards (in which a ""red winner"" is the potting of the red ball and a ""white winner"" the potting of the opponent's cue ball, each worth a different number of points).
The spot (usually not specially marked because it is obvious) on a snooker table at which the yellow ball is placed."

On 1 January 2020, coinciding with New Year's, Tovino Thomas officially announced through his social media pages that he would collaborate with Jithin Laal for an upcoming film, Ajayante Randam Moshanam.
Tovino will be seen in triple role for the first time as Maniyan, Ajayan and Kunjikelu; characters from three different timelines; 1900, 1950, and 1990.
Filming
Rohit Panikker of Times Now gave 4/5 stars and wrote, ""Ajayante Randam Moshanam is a visual spectacle supported by some masterful story-telling.
If not anything, the film is worth it for its performances from all quarters, but most of all, as a story-telling vehicle that has taken Tovino Thomas the performer up a few notches.
Anna Mathews of The Times of India gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote, ""Ajayante Randam Moshanam could be like another one of those impressive films that have come out of the Malayalam industry - which is currently ailing from several issues driven by the Hema Committee report - but does it have that emotional hook to pull in audiences is a question that we will have to wait and watch out for"".
Goutham S of Pinkvilla gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote, ""Ajayante Randam Moshanam aka ARM is surely not a commercial cinema that is filled with crazy elements or fanfare.
Kirubhakar Purushothaman of News18 gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote, ""In Ranjith’s film, the coveted object is gold; in ARM, it’s the lamp.

The Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB) catalogs all works set in the fictional universe that includes Known Space under the series name Tales of Known Space, which was the title of a 1975 collection of Niven's short stories.
Stories in the Known Space series include events and places outside of the region called ""Known Space"" such as the Ringworld, the Pierson's Puppeteers' Fleet of Worlds and the Pak homeworld.
In the late 1980s—having written almost no Tales of Known Space in more than a decade—Niven opened the 300-year gap in the Known Space timeline as a shared universe, and the stories of the Man-Kzin Wars volumes fill in that history, bridging the two settings.
One aspect of the Known Space universe is that most of the early human colonies are on planets suboptimal for Homo sapiens.
A common title for people born on Earth is ""Flatlander""; having been born and raised in the only environment in Known Space to which humans are well-adapted, they are considered naïve and a bit helpless by humans from colony worlds.
Mars, fourth planet in the Solar System and the first planetary colony in Known Space.
It has habitable areas but has high surface gravity of 1.78 times Earth, near the limits of human extended tolerance.
Jinxian humans are short and squat, the strongest bipeds in Known Space.
Wunderland is a planet circling Alpha Centauri, and was the earliest extra-solar colony in Known Space's human history.
Silvereyes is, at the time of Ringworld, the furthest Human world from Earth (21.3 light-years, 60 days at Quantum-I hyperdrive speeds), orbiting Beta Hydri.
Stories earlier in the timeline feature technology such as Bussard ramjets and drouds (wires capable of directly stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain), and explore how organ transplantation technology enables the new crime of organlegging (as well as the general sociological effects of widespread transplant technology), while later stories feature hyperdrive, invulnerable starship hulls, stasis fields, molecular monofilaments, transfer booths (teleporters used only on planetary surfaces), the lifespan-extending drug boosterspice, and the tasp which is an extension of the droud which works without direct contact.
Faster-than-light (FTL) propulsion, or hyperdrive, was obtained from the Outsiders at the end of the First Man–Kzin War. In addition to winning the war for humanity, it allowed the re-integration of all the human colonies, which were previously separated by distance.
In the vast majority of Known Space material, hyperdrive requires that a ship be outside a star's gravity well to use.
For example, though a high speed impact with the surface of a planet or star may cause no harm to the hull, the occupants will be crushed if they are not protected by additional measures such as a stasis field (Ringworld) or a gravity compensating field.
This is used in World of Ptavvs where humans develop a stasis field technology and realize that a mirrored artifact known as the Sea Statue must be actually an alien in a stasis field.
The stepping disks are an outgrowth and improvement of the transfer booth technology used by humans and other Known Space races.
The Pierson's Puppeteers engineer a lottery for child licenses on Earth to increase the occurrence of ""luck"", which they think is a paranormal ability humans have that has enabled them to defeat races such as the Kzinti.
Their jurisdiction is limited to the Earth-Moon system; other human colonies have their own militia.
Nevertheless, in many Known Space stories, ARM agents operate or exert influence in other human star systems through the ""Bureau of Alien Affairs"" (see ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"", ""Procrustes"", ""The Borderland of Sol"", and ""Neutron Star"").
The Tales of Known Space were first published primarily as short stories or serials in science fiction magazines.
There are also two or three short stories which share common themes and some background elements with Known Space stories, but which are not considered a part of the Known Space universe: ""One Face"" (1965) and ""Bordered in Black"" (1966)—both in the 1979 collection Convergent Series—and possibly ""The Color of Sunfire"", published online and listed here.
In the Known Space stories, Niven had created a number of technological devices (GP hull, stasis field, Ringworld material) which, combined with the ""Teela Brown gene"", made it very difficult to construct engaging stories beyond a certain date—the combination of factors made it tricky to produce any kind of creditable threat/problem without complex contrivances.
The author also published an ""outline"" for a story which would ""destroy"" the Known Space Series (or more precisely, reveal much of the Known Space background to be an in-universe hoax), in an article entitled ""Down in Flames"" Archived 2013-09-17 at the Wayback Machine.

The first firearms originated in 10th-century China, when bamboo tubes containing gunpowder and pellet projectiles were mounted on spears to make the portable fire lance, operable by a single person, which was later used effectively as a shock weapon in the siege of De'an in 1132.
Most modern firearms (with the notable exception of smoothbore shotguns) have rifled barrels to impart spin to the projectile for improved flight stability.
Further classification may make reference to the type of barrel used (i.e. rifled) and to the barrel length (e.g. 24 inches), to the firing mechanism (e.g. matchlock, wheellock, flintlock, or percussion lock), to the design's primary intended use (e.g. hunting rifle), or to the commonly accepted name for a particular variation (e.g. Gatling gun).
A firearm is a barreled ranged weapon that inflicts damage on targets by launching one or more projectiles driven by rapidly expanding high-pressure gas produced by exothermic combustion (deflagration) of a chemical propellant, historically black powder, now smokeless powder.
Such firearms include handguns such as pistols, revolvers, and derringers; and long guns such as rifles (and their subtypes), shotguns, submachine guns, and machine guns.
A handgun is, as defined generally and in many gun laws, a firearm that can be used with a single hand.
Early long arms, from the Renaissance up to the mid-19th century, were generally smoothbore firearms that fired one or more ball shot, called muskets or arquebus depending on caliber and firing mechanism.
Shotguns share many qualities with rifles, such as both being descendants of early long guns such as the musket; both having bolt-action, lever-action, break-action, pump-action, semi-automatic, and automatic variants; and both being popular with militaries, police, and civilians for largely the same reasons.
Though automatic rifles are sometimes considered to be their own category, they are also occasionally considered to be other types of firearms that postdated their invention, usually as light machine guns.
Automatic rifles are sometimes confused with machine guns or vice versa, or are defined as such by law; the National Firearms Act and Firearm Owners Protection Act define a ""machine gun"" in United States Code Title 26, Subtitle E, Chapter 53, Subchapter B, Part 1, § 5845 as ""...
""Machine gun"" is therefore largely synonymous with ""automatic weapon"" in American civilian parlance, covering all automatic firearms.
In most jurisdictions, automatic rifles, as well as automatic firearms in general, are prohibited from civilian purchase or are at least heavily restricted; in the U.S. for instance, most automatic rifles are Title II weapons that require certain licenses and are greatly regulated.
A machine gun is a fully-automatic firearm, chambered in intermediate or full-power rifle cartridges, designed to provide sustained automatic direct fire as opposed to the semi-automatic or burst fire of standard rifles.
A closely related concept is the squad automatic weapon, a portable light machine gun or even a modified rifle that is designed and fielded to provide a squad with rapid direct fire.
A submachine gun is a magazine-fed carbine chambered in a small-caliber handgun cartridge (such as 9×19mm Parabellum, .45 ACP, .22 Long Rifle, and .40 S&W).
A personal defense weapon is, in simplest terms, a submachine gun that is designed to fire ammunition with ballistic performance that is similar to (but not actually a type of) rifle cartridges, often called ""sub-intermediate"" cartridges.
Personal defense weapons were developed to provide rear and ""second-line"" personnel not otherwise armed with high-caliber firearms (vehicle and weapon crews, engineers, logistical personnel, etc.) with a method of effective self-defense against skirmishers and infiltrators who cannot effectively be defeated by low-powered submachine guns and handguns, often the only firearms suitable for those personnel (while they could be issued rifles or carbines, those would become unnecessary burdens in their normal duties, during which the likelihood of hostility is fairly rare regardless, making their issuance questionable).
Manual action or manual operation is essentially any type of firearm action that is loaded, and usually also fired, one cartridge at a time by the user, rather than automatically.
Manual action firearms can be divided into two basic categories: single-shot firearms that can only be fired once per barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps; and repeating firearms that can be fired multiple times per barrel, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger or ignite, and the firearm's action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism between trigger pulls.
Semi-automatic, self-loading, or autoloading is a firearm action that, after a single discharge, automatically performs the feeding and ignition procedures necessary to prepare the firearm for a subsequent discharge.
Automatic is a firearm action that uses the same automated action cycling as semi-automatic, but continues to do so for as long as the trigger is actuated, until the trigger is let go of or the firearm is depleted of available ammunition.
Automatic firearms are further defined by the type of cycling principles used, such as recoil operation (uses energy from the recoil to cycle the action), blowback (uses energy from the cartridge case as it is pushed by expanding gas), blow forward (use propellant gas pressure to open the breech), or gas operation (uses high-pressure gas from a fired cartridge to dispose of the spent case and load a new cartridge).
Even though the knowledge of making gunpowder-based weapons in the Nusantara archipelago had been known after the failed Mongol invasion of Java (1293), and the predecessor of firearms, the pole gun (bedil tombak), was recorded as being used by Java in 1413,: 245  the knowledge of making ""true"" firearms came much later, after the middle of 15th century.
The original predecessor of all firearms, the Chinese hand cannon from the 13th century, was loaded with gunpowder and the projectile (initially lead shot, later replaced by cast iron) through the muzzle, while a fuse was placed at the rear.
Muzzle-loading muskets (smooth-bored long guns) were among the first firearms developed.
It was neither a very reliable nor popular firearm, but it enabled a form of ""automatic"" fire long before the advent of the machine gun.
Many firearms made from the late-19th century through the 1950s used internal magazines to load the cartridge into the chamber of the weapon.
Firearms that have internal magazines are usually, but not always, rifles.
Many modern firearms use what are called detachable or box magazines as their method of chambering a cartridge.
A belt or ammunition belt, a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm, is commonly used with machine guns.
The brass cartridge also opened the way for modern repeating arms, by uniting the bullet, gunpowder, and primer into one assembly that could be fed reliably into the breech by mechanical action in the firearm.
A magazine is a part of the firearm which exists to store ammunition and to assist in its feeding by the action into the breech (such as through the rotation of a revolver's cylinder or by spring-loaded platforms in most pistol and rifle designs).
Some magazines, such as that of most centerfire hunting rifles and all revolvers, are internal to and inseparable from the firearm, and are loaded by using a ""clip"".
Many firearms are ""single shot"": i.e., each time a cartridge is fired, the operator must manually re-cock the firearm and load another cartridge.
A lever-action rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and most bolt-action rifles are good examples of repeating firearms.
The first ""rapid firing"" firearms were usually similar to the 19th-century Gatling gun, which would fire cartridges from a magazine as fast as and as long as the operator turned a crank.
Automatic rifles such as the Browning automatic rifle were in common use by the military during the early part of the 20th century, and automatic rifles that fired handgun rounds, known as submachine guns, also appeared at this time.
Many modern military firearms have a selective fire option, which is a mechanical switch that allows the firearm to be fired either in the semi-automatic or fully automatic mode.
For practical purposes, a firearm, in the U.S., is defined as the part of a weapon- designed to use expanded gas caused by the combustion of explosive material, to propel a projectile- which houses the fire control group (trigger & sear).
In India, the arms act, 1959, provides a definition of firearms where ""firearms"" means arms of any description designed or adapted to discharge a projectile or projectiles of any kind by the action of any explosive or other forms of energy, and includes:
In this context, since 2017, firearms are considered as ""any portable barrelled weapon that expels, is designed to expel or may be converted to expel a shot, bullet or projectile by the action of a combustible propellant"".
In the UK, a firearm does not have to use a combustible propellant, as explained by Crown Prosecution Service Guidance Firearms The Firearms Act 1968 Section 57(1B), uses the definition of a firearm as a ""lethal barrelled weapon"" as a ""barrelled weapon of any description from which a shot, bullet or other missile, with kinetic energy of more than one joule as measured at the muzzle of the weapon, can be discharged"".
firearm means a barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet, or other projectile can be discharged and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and includes any frame or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can be adapted for use as a firearm; (arme à feu)
any barreled weapon which will or is designed to or may be readily converted to expel a bullet or projectile by the action of an explosive, except antique firearms manufactured before the 20th Century or their replicas; or
""Firearm"" shall mean any portable barrelled weapon that expels, is designed to expel or may be readily converted to expel a shot, bullet or projectile by the action of an explosive, excluding antique firearms or their replicas."
chair,In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university 's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist .,['d005.s038.t005'],['chair%1:04:00::'],"['a seat for one person, with a support for the back']","Professors in the United States commonly occupy any of several positions of teaching and research within a college or university.
In the U.S., the word ""professor"" is often used to refer to anyone who teaches at a college of university level at any academic rank.
Other tenure-track faculty positions include assistant professor (entry level) and associate professor (mid-level).
Other teaching-focused positions that use the term ""professor"" include Clinical Professor, Professor of Practice, and Teaching Professor (specific roles and status vary widely among institutions, but usually do not involve tenure).
In the United States, while ""Professor"" as a proper noun (with a capital ""P"") generally implies a position title officially bestowed by a university or college to faculty members with a PhD or the highest level terminal degree in a non-academic field (e.g., MFA, MLIS), the common noun ""professor"" is often used casually to refer to anyone teaching at the college level, regardless of rank or degree.
After 7 years, in most American colleges and universities, a tenure-track faculty member (usually assistant professor) must be either awarded tenure, or dismissed from the university.
Educators who hold a formal title of ""Professor"" (referred to as tenured/tenure-track faculty) typically begin their careers as assistant professors (or ""lecturers"" and ""senior lecturers""), with subsequent promotions to the ranks of associate professor and finally professor.
The decision to grant tenure and promotion from assistant to associate professor usually requires numerous levels of approval, with a common sequence being:
Individuals in these positions who typically (though not always) focus on teaching undergraduate courses do not engage in research (except in the case of ""research professors""), may or may not have administrative or service roles, and sometimes are eligible for job security that is less strong than tenure.
Collegiate professor, teaching professor, or clinical professor (with or without ranks): More recent titles with many different variations, sometimes dependent upon rank; these instructors may hold parallel ranks as their tenure-track counterparts (i.e., teaching assistant professor, teaching associate professor, and (full) teaching professor) at institutions whose policy is to only provide ""tenure"" to those who do research.
(These are often known as ""soft money"" positions.) Accordingly, research professor positions usually are not eligible to be awarded tenure, but may still have ranks parallel to tenure-track counterparts (e.g. assistant, associate, and full levels).
Visiting professor (with or without ranks): (a) A temporary assistant/associate/full professor position (see above), e.g. to cover the teaching load of a faculty member on sabbatical.
Although the term ""professor"" is often used to refer to any college or university teacher, there are different 'tiers' of professorship ranging from an entry-level position as an ""assistant professor"" to ""full professor"", a rank reserved for professors who have established themselves as experts within their academic fields.
As they progress in their established fields through research, teaching, and service, they can make bids for promotion and tenure, which typically elevates them to the rank of associate professor.
College and university teachers who hold the rank of lecturer or instructor are typically not tenured/tenure-track faculty, usually focus on teaching undergraduate courses, and are generally not involved in research, nor are they typically involved in department and university decision-making.
The rank of assistant professor generally is held for a probationary period of five to seven years, after which the individual will either be promoted to associate professor and granted tenure (i.e., cannot be fired without cause and a formal hearing process) or will be terminated from employment.
Rates for achieving tenure vary, depending on the institutions and areas of study; in most places at least 50% of assistant professors will eventually become tenured and promoted to associate professors; however, this number can be as low as 10% in natural sciences departments of top universities or in non-PhD-granting schools.
Upon successfully receiving tenure, an assistant professor usually is promoted to the rank of associate professor.
If an applicant is appointed to the rank of associate professor without tenure, the position is usually tenure-track with an expectation that the person will soon qualify for tenure.
At some institutions, individuals are promoted to the rank of associate professor prior to receiving tenure.
Often specific to one institution, titles such as ""president's professor"", ""university professor"", ""distinguished professor"", ""distinguished research professor"", ""distinguished teaching professor"", ""distinguished university professor"", or ""regents professor"" are granted to a small percentage of the top tenured faculty who are regarded as particularly important in their respective fields of research.
Adding to the confusion over the formal names of non-tenure track positions, in almost every case the common-noun descriptor ""professor"" is used informally for people who teach at a college or university, regardless of their formal job title, and the terms are often loosely interchanged by faculty and administrators.
For example, at the University of Iowa, the ranks are adjunct instructor, adjunct assistant professor, adjunct associate professor, and adjunct full professor; the University states that ""the expectations at each rank are similar to those for the same rank on the tenure track"".
In parallel with tenure-track faculty ranks, there are assistant and associate research professor positions."
chair,"He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him .",['d005.s042.t008'],['chair%1:04:00::'],"['a seat for one person, with a support for the back']","In Welsh culture, an eisteddfod is an institution and festival with several ranked competitions, including in poetry and music.: xvi 
The term eisteddfod, which is formed from the Welsh morphemes: eistedd, meaning 'sit', and fod, meaning 'be', means, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, ""sitting-together."" Edwards further defines the earliest form of the eisteddfod as a competitive meeting between bards and minstrels, in which the winner was chosen by a noble or royal patron.
During his two 20th-century terms as Archdruid of the Gorsedd Cymru, Albert Evans-Jones, whose bardic name was Cynan and who was a war poet and minister of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, created new rituals for both the Gorsedd and the eisteddfod which are based upon the Christian beliefs of the Welsh people rather than upon Modern Druidry.
Since its 18th-century revival, the eisteddfod tradition has been carried all over the world by the Welsh diaspora.
Today's eisteddfodau (plural form) and the National Eisteddfod of Wales in particular, are in equal parts a Renaissance fair, a Celtic festival, a musical festival, a literary festival, and ""the supreme exhibition of the Welsh culture."": 52 
In some other countries, the term eisteddfod is used for performing arts competitions that have nothing to do with Welsh culture or the Welsh language.
The proclamation is to read as follows, ""When the year of Our Lord ----, and the period of the Gorsedd of the Bards of Britain within the summer solstice, after summons and invitation to all to all of Wales through the Gorsedd Trumpet, under warning of a year and a day, in sight and hearing of lords and commons and in the face of the sun, the eye of light, be it known that a Gorsedd and Eisteddfod will be held at the town of ----, where protections will be afforded to all who seek privilege, dignity, and license in Poetry and Minstrelsy...
And thither shall come the Archdruid and the Gorsedd and others, Bards and Licensiates of the Privilege and Robe of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, there to hold judgment of Chair and Gorsedd on Music and Poetry concerning the muse, conduct, and learning of all that may come to seek the National Eisteddfod honours, according to the privilege and customs of the Gorsedd of Bards of the Isle of Britain:
Also according to Morris, ""the Eisteddfod is essentially competitive: there are competitions for penillion, and englynion, and male voice choirs, and poems in strict meter, and poems in free metre, and essays, and translations, and plays, and short stories."" Also, according to Morris, ""outside the Pabell Lên, the Literary Tent, poets mutter couplets to themselves, or exchange bitter Bardic complaints."": 156-157 
To win the chair or the crown competitions, particularly at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, grants even previously unknown poets and writers enormous publicity and prestige.
At the National Eisteddfod, a Gold Medal (Welsh: Medal Aur) is annually awarded in three categories; Fine Art, Architecture, and Craft and Design.
According to legend, Gruffudd ap Cynan (1055–1137), the Dublin-born King of Gwynedd from the House of Aberffraw and the descendant of Rhodri Mawr, Sigtrygg Silkbeard, and Brian Boru, not only reformed the Welsh bardic schools to accord with those that trained the Irish language bards, but also served as patron to an eisteddfod at Caerwys during his reign.: 9 
When asked about Turvey's theory, recognized eisteddfod historian Hywel Teifi Edwards said, ""It's conjecture, but there's no doubt that there was a bardic tradition of competition for status before this time."" Edwards further stated that any foreign influence was an indication of how very cosmopolitan Medieval Wales had been.
At the eisteddfod the Cadair Arian ('Silver Chair'), which is said to have been fashioned by Gruffudd ap Nicolas himself, was won by a cywydd in honour of the Holy Trinity composed by Dafydd ab Edmwnd, a Welsh poet who did not depend on noble patronage, from Hanmer, Flintshire.: 6-8  Welsh poet and Roman Catholic priest Llawdden, however, accused Gruffudd ap Nicolas of accepting a bribe from Dafydd ab Edmwnd in return for the Silver Chair.
In 1523, an eisteddfod was held at Caerwys under King Henry VIII's charter and was led by Welsh bard and future Franciscan friar, Tudur Aled.
The Statute listed the rights of bards in Welsh culture and under traditional Welsh law, while also arguing that bards should not drink to excess, womanize, or gamble.: 8–10  In addition, the Statute further stated that a true bard must never write satirical poetry: 28–29  and codified the rules of praise poetry at a time when the Welsh bardic tradition of was increasingly under threat and, ""demanded that the bard celebrate in elevated language the orderliness of a God-centered world."": 8–10
Despite their battles similar to his own against government censorship, Sir Philip Sidney, in An Apology for Poetry, expressed both admiration for and evny of the prestige that poets enjoyed in Welsh culture, which he contrasted with what he described as the Elizabethan era tendency in English culture to treat poets as unwanted stepchildren, ""In Wales, the true remnant of the ancient Brittons, as there are good authorities to show, the long time they had poets which they called Bards: so through all the conquests of Romans, Saxons, Danes, and Normans, some of whom, did seek to ruin all memory of learning from among them, yet do their poets even to this day last: so as it is not more notable in the soon beginning, then in long continuing.""
Even though there is a major difference between Cymraeg Llenyddol and all 21st century spoken dialects of the Welsh language, eisteddfod submissions are still required to be composed in the literary language of Bishop Morgan's Bible, which remains the foundation upon which all subsequent Welsh literature has been built.
According to Marcus Tanner, Queen Elizabeth I's experiment at royal patronage of the eisteddfod did not catch on and, as the 16th and 17th centuries progressed, the Welsh nobility became increasingly Anglicized and ceased to grant employment or hospitality to Welsh-language poets.
Although eisteddfodau continued, the gatherings became more informal; Welsh poets would often meet in taverns, cemeteries, or inns to have ""assemblies of rhymers"".: 192  But the interest of the Welsh people dwindled to such a point that the eisteddfod held at Glamorgan in 1620 attracted an audience of only four people.: 192  The winners, however, continued to receive a chair, which was a highly prized award because of its perceived social status.
In 1701, an eisteddfod was held at Machynlleth in order, ""To begin to renew the eisteddfod of bards (as they were in olden times), to reprimand false cynghanedd, to explain the difficult things, and to confirm what is correct in the art of poetry in the Welsh language."": 12 
Although the Gwyneddigion did not succeed in their ambition of transforming the eisteddfod ""into an Academy that would act as a forcing house for Welsh culture"", they have wielded considerable influence over continued requirement for long poems as eisteddfod submissions.: 14  Furthermore, in reaction to the incomprehensibility of Welsh poetry composed in strict meter, the Gwyneddigion held up the recent poetry of Reverend Goronwy Owen as a better model.: 14–15 
Owen felt, however, that the rules of Welsh poetry in strict meter prevented him from doing so.: 14–15  Therefore, by holding Owen up as a model, the Gwyneddigion ensured that his literary legacy is that, as late as 1930, both the adjudicators and the poets composing submissions to the National Eisteddfod of Wales were aspiring to produce the Welsh national epic that Owen had longed to write in vain.: 29–31 
According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, while the awarding of a chair is a very old tradition, the now-familiar ceremony of the chairing of the bard who has composed the best awdl dates from the eisteddfod revival of the early 1790s.: 15 
During the 1790 eisteddfod held at St. Asaph, Gwyneddigion Society member Edward Williams, whose bardic name was Iolo Morganwg, became convinced that he and his fellow Welsh poets were the descendants of the Druids and that the eisteddfod was a survival of Druidic ritual.
In 1858 John Williams, whose bardic name was Ab Ithel, held a ""national"" eisteddfod with the Gorsedd Cymru in Llangollen.
A writer for The Times went even farther, calling the eisteddfod ""simply foolish interference with the natural progress of civilization and prosperity – it is a monstrous folly to encourage the Welsh in a loving fondness for their old language."": 155 
Before the 1858 Llangollen eisteddfod was over, however, a meeting of Welsh literati had taken place and decided that an annual national eisteddfod, conducted with due regard for standards, was long overdue.
The Welsh poet Lewis William Lewis (1831–1901), whose bardic name was Llew Llwyfo, repeatedly attempted in his eisteddfod submissions to, ""achieve the national epic that would merit translation into the major literatures"".
Although Edwards is very critical of Llew Llwyfo and accuses him of following the then common practice of imitating Victorian-era English poetry,: 30-31  Lewis' poetry repeatedly won first prize at multiple eisteddfodau held both in Wales and within Welsh-American immigrant communities.
Even though the title had been previously chosen by the eisteddfod judges, almost certainly in the hope of inspiring a Welsh equivalent to Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King, Thomas Gwynn Jones' hugely influential awdl, Ymadawiad Arthur (""The Passing of Arthur"") won its author the bardic chair at the National Eisteddfod in 1902.
It was the award of the bardic chair during the second day of the 1917 National Eisteddfod of Wales at Birkenhead Park in the English city of the same name.
Mab y Bwthyn ""tells, in a gushingly romantic, lyrical style how a young gwerinwr, scarred by the horrors of war, turns from the fetid city to seek spiritual renewal in the natural beauty of his home and the love of a pure country girl."" Cynan's poem has been called the best-loved pryddest ever composed during the 20th century and many Welsh people, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, are still able to recite long passages of it from memory.: 59-60  Alan Llwyd, who has translated part of Mab y Bwthyn into English for the 2008 book Out of the Fire of Hell: Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914–1918 in Prose and Verse, has argued that Cynan, rather than the far more famous Hedd Wyn, is the greatest Welsh war poet.
Plaid Cymru, a Welsh nationalist and social democratic political party, was founded during the 1925 National Eisteddfod at Pwllheli, Gwynedd.
At the 1936 National Eisteddfod held at Fishguard (Welsh: Abergwaun), the set title for the Bardic Crown was Yr Anialwch ('The Wasteland'), which was almost certainly inspired by T.S. Eliot's famous Modernist poem of the same name.
In 1985, the long-term effects of Saunders Lewis' Tynged yr Iaith were listed by Gwyn Williams: the formation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg in 1962, direct action against English-language offices, roadsigns, and TV masts, sit-ins and demonstrations, Welsh-language schools, the 1973 adoption of adult education in the Welsh language based upon the Ulpan system created in the State of Israel for teaching the Hebrew language and Israeli culture to adult immigrants, the 1964 creation of the office of Secretary of State for Wales, the 1967 passing of the Welsh Language Act, the creation of S4C, and the mushrooming of Welsh-language publishing, film production, pop and rock, as well as youth and urban music.
He was also the first Archdruid to accept that the Gorsedd is an 18th-century invention by Iolo Morganwg and that it has no links to Welsh mythology or to the ancient Druids, thus healing rifts between the academic and ecclesiastical establishments and the eisteddfod movement.
Cynan is also responsible for designing the modern ceremonies of the crowning and chairing of the bard in the eisteddfod as they are now performed, by creating ceremonies which, he thought, better reflected the Christian beliefs of the Welsh people.
Although it has been held since 1929, the most notable event in the history of the Welsh youth festival known as the Urdd National Eisteddfod took place at Aberystwyth, also in 1969.
The fallout afterwards was heated and an editorial in the Welsh-language newspaper Y Cymro severely angered the director of the Urdd National Eisteddfod.
In 1999 the centenary of early Gaelic revival poet and Easter Rising leader Patrick Pearse's initiation into the Gorsedd at the 1899 Pan Celtic Eisteddfod in Cardiff (where he took the Bardic name of Areithiwr) was marked by the unveiling of a plaque at the Consulate General of the Irish Republic in Wales.
In a ceremony held entirely in the Welsh language during the 2002 National Eisteddfod at St. David's, Rowan Williams, the Anglican Archbishop of Wales, was sworn into the Gorsedd as a ""White Druid"" under the bardic name ""Ap Aneurin"".
During the 2018 National Eisteddfod at Cardiff, the bardic crown was awarded to poet and Welsh nationalist Catrin Dafydd, born in Gwaelod y Garth, for her collection Olion (""Traces"").
The most important is the National Eisteddfod of Wales, the largest festival of competitive music and poetry in Europe.
Among the elements from Welsh culture that travelled with these émigrés was the eisteddfod, which – in a variety of forms and languages – continues to exist worldwide.
Although eisteddfodau have been held in Argentina ever since the first Welsh immigrants arrived aboard the Mimosa in 1865, assimilation and the loss of contact with the homeland caused both the distinctive Patagonian dialect of the Welsh language and the eisteddfod tradition to be seriously endangered.
Williams won the Bardic Chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in both 1964 and 1968, and from 1975 to 1978 he served as Archdruid of the Gorsedd Cymru.
Current eisteddfod competitions are bilingual, in both Patagonian Welsh and Argentine Spanish, and include poetry, prose, literary translations (Welsh, Spanish, English, Italian, and French), musical performances, arts, folk dances, photography, and filmmaking, among others.
Eisteddfods (Australian English: plural) in the traditional Welsh sense have also been adopted into Australian culture.
During the subsequent revival of the eisteddfod, the Gwyneddigion Society held up the poetry of Owen as an example for bards at future eisteddfodau to emulate.
During the eisteddfod revival of the 1790s, Gwyneddigion Society member William Jones, who had enthusiastically supported the American Revolution and who was arguing for the creation of a National Eisteddfod of Wales, had come to believe that the completely Anglicized Welsh nobility, through rackrenting and their employment of unscrupulous land agents, had forfeited all right to the obedience and respect of their tenants.
Local Welsh-language poet James Price, whose bardic name was Ap Dewi ('Son of David'), was born at Newark, Ohio to parents from Llanon, Ceredigion.: 254  After migrating to the Minnesota frontier, Ap Dewi served as a deacon and Sunday school teacher at the Horeb Calvinistic Methodist Church in Cambria Township, Blue Earth County: 64  and was so dominant at local eisteddfodau that he was considered the ""prifardd of Minnesota."": 138 
The first Welsh literary society in Minnesota was founded, according to Ap Dewi, at a meeting held in South Bend Township, also in Blue Earth County in the fall of 1855.: 129  Also according to Ap Dewi, ""The first eisteddfod in the state of Minnesota was held in Judson in the house of Wm. C.
Jones, a Calvinistic Methodist minister born at Ty Rhedyn, near Marian-glas, Anglesey and Welsh-language writer whose literary talents drew comparisons with Washington Irving,: 215-216  the first eisteddfod held in Cambria Township took place on the Fourth of July, 1871.
The first eisteddfod held in the Twin Cities took place, ""on a fairly large scale"", and sponsored by the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis, on 17 January 1885.: 210-211 
A third Minneapolis eisteddfod was held, under the patronage of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel and Y Wyddorfa, the Welsh literary society of Minneapolis, on St. David's Day, 1894.
Also during the American Civil War, Edward Thomas, a Welsh-language poet born in Centerville, Ohio to parents from Llanidloes and whose bardic name was Awenydd, was living and working as a schoolmaster at the Welsh-American farming settlement at South Bend Township, in Blue Earth County, Minnesota.
During his service in that regiment, Thomas wrote many Welsh-language poems, including Pryddest ar Wir Fawredd, which later won the bardic crown at an eisteddfod held in Minersville, Pennsylvania.
At the same eisteddfod, Reverend Evan Reese, a Calvinistic Methodist minister from Puncheston, Pembrokeshire, and Welsh poet whose bardic name was Dyfed, won the bardic chair and the $500 prize money offered for a 2,000 line awdl on the set subject Iesu o Nazareth ('Jesus of Nazareth').: 31  Reese went on to become the Archdruid of the Gorsedd Cymru and to announce the posthumous victory of Hedd Wyn at the infamous 1917 Eisteddfod of the Black Chair.
The 2011 West Coast Eisteddfod event was co-curated by Lorin Morgan-Richards and held at the Barnsdall Art Park in Los Angeles, the site of Welsh-American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House, near Griffith Park, founded by Welsh-American philanthropist Griffith J.
Welsh Heritage Week and Cwrs Cymraeg, two ambulatory Welsh language and culture courses held annually, usually in the United States, also each feature a mini-eisteddfod.
The North American Festival of Wales held by the Welsh North American Association also includes an eisteddfod.
Even though the neo-bardic, Gorsedd, and Eisteddfod movement in Brittany was founded during the early 19th century by Auguste Brizeux, the real heyday of the movement took place between 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War. Those two decades were dominated by François Jaffrenou, whose bardic name was Taldir, and who introduced many Iolo Morganwg-inspired elements of Welsh culture into Breton culture and literature.
Since it was founded as part of the Gaelic revival by Conradh na Gaeilge in 1897, the eisteddfod-inspired festival known as Oireachtas na Gaeilge was envisaged to spearhead a renaissance of Irish-language literature, culture, and the arts.
Since it was also founded by Conradh na Gaeilge in 1902, Seachtain na Gaeilge (English: Irish Language Week), which is similarly based upon the Welsh eisteddfod, has celebrated Irish traditional music, Gaelic games, and Irish culture.
After the end of the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Civil War, the 1924-1937 revival of the ancient Tailteann Games also emulated the Welsh Eisteddfod by including ceremonies in Pre-Christian Irish clothing and inspired by Irish mythology.
The Scottish Gaelic mòd, a festival of Scottish Gaelic song, literature, arts and culture, is modeled upon the Welsh eisteddfod.
In response, An Comunn Gàidhealach was founded at Oban in 1891 to help preserve the Scottish Gaelic language and its literature and to establish the Royal National Mòd (Am Mòd Nàiseanta Rìoghail), as a festival of Gaelic music, literature, arts, and culture deliberately modelled upon the National Eisteddfod of Wales.
According to Ronald Black, ""In 1923, following the example of the Welsh Eisteddfod, An Commun Gàidhealach simplified the structure of its annual poetry competitions into a single contest for a Bardic Crown (Scottish Gaelic: Crùn na Bàrdachd), the winner to be acknowledged as Bard of An Commun (Scottish Gaelic: Bàird a' Chomuinn Gàidhealaich) for the coming year.
The 1992 Welsh-language biographical film Hedd Wyn focuses on war poet Ellis Humphrey Evans' (Huw Garmon) pursuit of his lifelong dream of winning the bardic chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and on his three-year-long battle against overwhelming pressure to enlist in the British Army during World War I.

chair,Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair .,['d022.s102.t004'],['chair%1:06:00::'],"['a seat for one person, with a support for the back']","A chair is a type of seat, typically designed for one person and consisting of one or more legs, a flat or slightly angled seat and a back-rest.
Chairs vary in design.
They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today's chairs – chair seats were sometimes only 10 inches (25 cm) high.
In some cases, multiple materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic.
Some chairs have foot rests.
The popliteal height, after adjusting for heels, clothing and other issues, is used to determine the height of the chair seat.
In general, if the occupant is supposed to sit for a long time, weight needs to be taken off the seat area and thus ""easy"" chairs intended for long periods of sitting are generally at least slightly reclined.
The back of the chair will support some of the weight of the occupant, reducing the weight on other parts of the body.
Reclining chairs typically have at least shoulder-height back-rests to shift weight to the shoulders.
Types of chairs
Office chair
Work chair
Rocking chair
Kneeling chair
A sit-stand chair distributes most of the weight of the occupant to the feet.
Many chairs are padded or have cushions.
Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have.
Center seats where a solid material forms the chair seat

American-style strip clubs began to appear outside North America after World War II, arriving in Asia in the late 1980s and Europe in 1978, where they competed against the local English and French styles of striptease and erotic performances.
In 2019, the size of the U.S. strip club industry was estimated to be US$8 billion, generating 19% of the total gross revenue in legal adult entertainment.
Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits.
""Top Strip Club"" lists in some media have demonstrated that U.S.-style striptease is a global phenomenon and that it has also become a culturally accepted form of entertainment, despite its scrutiny in legal circles and popular media.
Strip clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a contentious issue in popular culture and politics.
Changes in the law in the 1960s brought about a boom of strip clubs in Soho with ""fully nude"" dancing and audience participation.
Originally an X-rated movie theater, this striptease club pioneered lap dancing in 1970, and was a major force in popularizing it in strip clubs on a nationwide and eventually worldwide basis.
Customers in peeping clubs view a female model through a hole from their own private cubicles, and then pay to watch her strip, pose, and masturbate.
Regardless of size, name, or location in the world, strip clubs can be full nude, topless or bikini.
Beyond this more passive entertainment, some clubs' dancers offer additional services, such as lap dances or trips to the champagne room, for a set fee rather than for tips.
Touching of strippers is not permitted in many localities, however, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances.
In clubs which offer lingerie modeling shows, which are peep shows where a dancer privately dances and strips for a customer, typically without a barrier, performances can also be done with or without a formal stage or music.
Club management may set standard prices for the various dance services, but individual strippers, where permitted, will negotiate their own prices, which may be higher or lower than the advertised rate.
A service provided by many clubs is for a customer to be placed on stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance.
Bed dances are the least common of the three, and in many clubs are a more expensive option than a lap dance because of the novelty and increased level of contact between customer and service provider.
Performers and staff are the primary customer service representatives in the club environment.
Dancers continually interact with the customers in the club.
Within the context of the strip club, dancers might sometimes give the impression that they are revealing private (or backstage) information to customers in order to play a confidence game for increased profit.
Customers rarely, if ever, see the preparation of these props, since they are denied access to the backstage of a dancer's performance space by the layout of the club.
Rules governing strip clubs and the overall adult entertainment industry vary around the world and formats sometimes are combined under a single roof or complex.
Zürich, Switzerland, has legalized prostitution and its strip clubs throughout the city offer sex among their services.
Differing from Zurich brothels, sex services via the strip clubs are typically performed off site.
These included strip theaters, peep shows, ""soaplands"", ""lover's banks"", porno shops, telephone clubs, karaoke bars, clubs and more all offering adult entertainment services.
In the United States, clubs are classified based on typical performances, zoning regulations, and advertised services.
Elsewhere in North America, the Zona Norte red light district in Tijuana, Mexico, has a number of legal brothels which are modeled on strip clubs and feature U.S.-style striptease performed by its prostitutes.
Regardless of the floorplan, as an interactive theater, there are features every strip club will have.
A common type of strip club main stage is the thrust stage, also known as a runway stage, but the other major forms are also used regularly.
Theatre in the round is also a popular form of strip club staging for the main stage.
Each club and dancer has different tolerance levels for customer interaction, including tipping.
In Eastern European and Asian clubs, it is customary to agree on payment upfront for a certain amount of time or dances, for stage performances and any private sessions.
Some strip clubs consider ad hoc performances on satellite stages, paid for by a customer on a per song basis, a form of private dance.
Lap dance, peep show, and lingerie modeling clubs might only have satellite stages with pay to play entertainment options on their premises.
Shower shows require special equipment, so they are more likely to have a dedicated stage in the club with house dancers performing in the show.
Games are also a common feature of strip clubs.
Some clubs also have dedicated areas of the main floor dedicated to performing private dance services.
In higher-end clubs, VIP seating might include balconies and other overlooks, which might also include smaller stages for a private dance if the customer wishes, at an additional fee.
A champagne room (also called a champagne lounge, or champagne court) is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentlemen's clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises.
Clubs sell champagne by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer.
The service includes a live view into part of the backstage dressing room and paid access enables the website user to interact live with dancers at the club.
Strippers can sometimes be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment.
Aside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the sex industry.
Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex-for-hire is much more common and stripping in those settings is viewed as advertising for sexually oriented business that will be performed in either private areas of the club or off-premises.
In certain areas, doormen working outside the strip club will act as ""hype men"" enticing people to enter and sample the show and services.
Waitstaff are also employed to assist with providing drinks, and in some cases meals, to customers on the main floor and others areas of the club.
As of 2009, there were between 3,500 and 4,000 strip clubs in the United States alone.
The U.S. market for strip clubs was estimated to be as large as US$15 billion in 2005.
That same year, the U.S. state of California alone accounted for US$1 billion in revenue, and the total size of the global strip club industry was estimated to be US$75 billion.
Strip clubs offering American striptease and other adult entertainment services have been established on six of seven continents (all except Antarctica), and the demand for these types of business is soaring in economically developing nations.
Most adult entertainment companies, which include strip clubs, are in privately held ownership.
Publicly reported earning statements for U.S. companies operating strip clubs have not provided guidance on how they define their market segment, non-public competitors, or overall industry revenue.
Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits.
Service revenues include entertainer payments to perform at clubs, customer admission fees, customer payments for tabs and tip charges, dance dollar payments, and suite rental fees.
External factors, such as location and public perception, have some impact on business, but the essential draw of the strip club is the live entertainment.
A few smaller strip clubs may pay a weekly wage but, in most cases, a dancer's income is derived entirely from tips and other fees, which they collect from customers.
In these cases, strippers receive payment in the form of tips and payment for specific services offered by the club (such as lap dances).
They can also double as stage and lap dance entertainers, depending on the club.
Marketing strategies for strip clubs include attracting new customers, increasing the frequency of visits by existing customers, and establishing a higher level of name recognition.
Strip clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a hot button issue in popular culture and politics.
Fully nude clubs may be subject to additional requirements, such as restrictions on alcohol sales and no-touch rules between customers and dancers.
Any strip clubs where live entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year must apply for a sexual entertainment venue licence from their local authorities.
In 2014, the East London Strippers Collective was formed to improve working conditions in strip clubs.

club,Would a camera club be useful in taking pictures pertinent to plant safety ?,['d000.s039.t001'],['club%1:14:00::'],['a team of professional baseball players who play and travel together'],"Electronic dance music (EDM), also referred to as club music, is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres originally made for nightclubs, raves, and festivals.
EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA.
By the early 2010s, the term ""electronic dance music"" and the initialism ""EDM"" was being pushed by the American music industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture.
Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the acronym remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno, electro and trance, as well as their respective subgenres, which all predate the acronym.
Other early examples of music that influenced later electronic dance music include Jamaican dub music during the late 1960s to 1970s, the synthesizer-based disco music of Italian producer Giorgio Moroder in the late 1970s, and the electropop of Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra in the mid-to-late 1970s.
Author Michael Veal considers dub music, a Jamaican music stemming from roots reggae and sound system culture that flourished between 1968 and 1985, to be one of the important precursors to contemporary electronic dance music.
Hip hop music has had some influence in the development of electronic dance music since the 1970s.
The track, which also featured the melody line from Riot In Lagos (1980) of Ryuichi Sakamoto, informed the development of electronic dance music, and subgenres including Miami bass and Detroit techno, and popularized the 808 as a ""fundamental element of futuristic sound"".
The Roland TR-909, TB-303 and Juno-60 similarly influenced electronic dance music such as techno, house and acid.
During the post-disco era that followed the backlash against ""disco"" which began in the mid to late 1979, which in the United States lead to civil unrest and a riot in Chicago known as the Disco Demolition Night,[13] an underground movement of ""stripped-down"" disco inspired music featuring ""radically different sounds""[14] started to emerge on the East Coast.[15] [Note 1] This new scene was seen primarily in the New York metropolitan area and was initially led by the urban contemporary artists that were responding to the over-commercialization and subsequent demise of disco culture.
The sound that emerged originated from P-Funk[18] the electronic side of disco, dub music, and other genres.
Much of the music produced during this time was, like disco, catering to a singles-driven market.[14] At this time creative control started shifting to independent record companies, less established producers, and club DJs.[14] Other dance styles that began to become popular during the post-disco era include dance-pop,[19] [20] boogie,[14] electro, Hi-NRG, Italo disco, house,[19] [21] [22] [23] and techno.[22] [24] [25] [26] [27]
In the early 1980s, Chicago radio jocks The Hot Mix 5 and club DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles played various styles of dance music, including older disco records (mostly Philly disco and Salsoul tracks), Italo Disco, electro funk tracks by artists such as Afrika Bambaataa, newer Italo disco, B-Boy hip hop music by Man Parrish, Jellybean Benitez, Arthur Baker, and John Robie, and electronic pop music by Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra.
The electronic instrumentation and minimal arrangement of Charanjit Singh's Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat (1982), an album of Indian ragas performed in a disco style, anticipated the sounds of acid house music, but it is not known to have had any influence on the genre prior to the album's rediscovery in the 21st century.
Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so-called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or beats per minute (BPM).
This subgenre was known as ""hardcore"" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo breakbeats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as ""jungle techno"", a genre influenced by Jack Smooth and Basement Records, and later just ""jungle"", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on pirate radio in Britain.
Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London in the late 1990s.
This form of trap music can be simplified by these three features: ""1/3 hip hop (tempo and song structure are similar, most tracks are usually between 70 and 110 bpm) – with vocals sometimes being pitched down, 1/3 dance music –  high-pitched Dutch synth work, hardstyle sampling, as well as a plethora of trap remixes of popular EDM songs, and 1/3 dub (low-frequency focus and strong emphasis on repetitiveness throughout a song)"".
EDM; computer programmed to perfection for your listening pleasure."" In response to a question about being credited with coining the term New Romantic Burgess has stated that: ""Initially I was using three terms – Futurist, Electronic Dance Music (the Landscape singles have EDM printed on them) and New Romantic.""
It has been described as an era of electronic music, being described in a MixMag article as being ""the drop-heavy, stadium-filling, fist-pumping, chart-topping, massively commercial main stage sound that conquered America...possibly somewhere between electro and progressive house, directed by Michael Bay, and like many music genres, trying to pin it down exactly is like trying to grab a fistful of water"".
In the UK, ""dance music"" or ""dance"" are more common terms for EDM.[4] What is widely perceived to be ""club music"" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM.
Both ""club music"" and ""EDM"" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).[96] Though Billboard debuted a ""dance"" chart in 1974, the larger US music industry did not create music charts until the late 1990s.[93] In July 1995, Nervous Records and Project X Magazine hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the ""Electronic Dance Music Awards"".[Note 4]
Electronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a recording studio with specialized equipment such as samplers, synthesizers, effects units and MIDI controllers all set up to interact with one another using the MIDI protocol.
Afro-EDM depicts African electronic dance music genres and styles that blend elements of traditional African music with electronic dance music.
Initially, the popularization of electronic dance music was associated with European rave and club culture and it achieved limited popular exposure in the United States.
In the late 1990s, despite US media interest in dance music re-branded as electronica, American house and techno producers continued to travel abroad to establish their careers as DJs and producers.
According to New York Times journalist Kelefa Sanneh, Aaliyah's 2000 single ""Try Again"" ""helped smuggle the innovative techniques of electronic dance music onto the American pop charts""
By the mid-2000s, Dutch producer Tiësto was bringing worldwide popular attention to EDM after providing a soundtrack to the entry of athletes during the opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics — an event which The Guardian deemed as one of the 50 most important events in dance music.
As noted by Entertainment Weekly, Justin Timberlake's ""SexyBack"" helped introduce EDM sounds to top 40 radio, as it brought together variations of electronic dance music with the singer's R&B sounds.
Other major acts that gained prominence, including Avicii and Swedish House Mafia, toured major venues such as arenas and stadiums rather than playing clubs; in December 2011, Swedish House Mafia became the first electronic music act to sell out New York City's Madison Square Garden.
Following the popularization of EDM in America a number of producers and DJs, including Carl Cox, Steve Lawler, and Markus Schulz, raised concerns that the perceived over-commercialisation of dance music had impacted the art of DJing.
Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of Shanghai's inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a title sponsorship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as Avicii and Wang Leehom's ""Lose Myself"".
A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market.
The popularity of EDM and festivals also led some multi-genre festivals not strongly associated with electronic music, such as Coachella and Lollapalooza, to add more electronic acts to their lineup.
Russell Smith of The Globe and Mail felt that the commercial festival industry was an antithesis to the original principles of the rave subculture, citing ""the expensive tickets, the giant corporate sponsors, the crass bro culture—shirtless muscle boys who cruise the stadiums, tiny popular girls in bikinis who ride on their shoulders – not to mention the sappy music itself."" Drug-related incidents, as well as other complaints surrounding the behaviour of their attendees, have contributed to negative perceptions and opposition to electronic music events by local authorities.
On March 4, 2020, Ultra Miami was the first electronic dance music festival to cancel an event since the event could not conform to the state's capacity rules and county's safety protocols and regulations.

Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann.
All of Chopin's compositions feature the piano.
Chopin's major piano works include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, the instrumental ballade (which Chopin created as an instrumental genre), études, impromptus, scherzi, preludes, and sonatas, some published only posthumously.
It hosts the International Chopin Piano Competition, a prestigious competition devoted entirely to his works.
His father played the flute and violin; his mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept.
Chopin may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the Czech pianist Wojciech Żywny.
Chopin's final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: ""Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius."" In 1829 the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.
After what would be Chopin's farewell concert in Warsaw in October 1830, which included the concerto, played by the composer, and Gładkowska singing an aria by Gioachino Rossini, the two exchanged rings, and two weeks later she wrote in his album some affectionate lines bidding him farewell.
Back in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin, and composed a set of variations, Souvenir de Paganini.
He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews – in addition to some commenting (in Chopin's own words) that he was ""too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists"".
Chopin arrived in Paris on 5 October 1831;
Two Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there.
Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris.
Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt, and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.
Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, ""I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies."" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology.
In June 1837, Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel, where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood.
The Pleyel piano finally arrived from Paris in December, just shortly before Chopin and Sand left the island.
George Sand gives a description of Chopin's playing in a letter of 28 April 1839:
During the summers at Nohant, particularly in the years 1839–1843 (except 1840), Chopin found quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53.
Sometimes, through the window which opens on the garden, a gust of music wafts up from Chopin at work.
S. [George Sand], who poisoned his whole being, he would have lived to be Cherubini's age."" Chopin would die two years later at thirty-nine; the composer Luigi Cherubini had died in Paris in 1842 at the age of 81.
At the graveside, the Funeral March from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber's instrumentation.
In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.
Chopin published his music in France, England, and the German states (i.e. he worked with as many as three separate publishers for each piece or set of pieces) due to the copyright laws of the time.
J. Barrie Jones suggests that ""amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzi stand supreme"", and adds that ""the Barcarolle Op. 60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody"".
The two mature Chopin piano sonatas (No. 2, Op. 35, written in 1839 and No. 3, Op. 58, written in 1844) are in four movements.
In Op. 35, Chopin combined within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique – ""a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle"".
In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace."" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well.

He further stated: ""One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity."" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.
Jonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance style – set in the ""conservatory"" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings – militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.
virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn"".
Chopin's music is frequently played with rubato, ""the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect"".
When living in Warsaw, Chopin composed and played on an instrument built by the piano-maker Fryderyk Buchholtz.
Later in Paris Chopin purchased a piano from Pleyel.
Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from ""urbanised"" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts by Jachimecki and others to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.
Jones comments that ""Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned."" He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831 – ""the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons"" – and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.
Elements of Chopin's music can be found in many of Liszt's later works.
Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs.
In Paris, Chopin had a number of pupils, including Friedericke Müller, who left memoirs of his teaching and the prodigy Carl Filtsch, to whom both Chopin and Sand became dedicated, Chopin giving him three lessons a week; Filtsch was the only pupil to whom Chopin gave lessons in composition, and, exceptionally, he on several occasions shared a concert platform with him.
Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their students, some of whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to make recordings of his music.
Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano Études to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the Paris Conservatoire, and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.
Alexander Scriabin was devoted to the music of Chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas as well as numerous études and preludes; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him in Chopin's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer.
The world's oldest monographic music competition, the International Chopin Piano Competition, founded in 1927, is held every five years in Warsaw.
The Fryderyk Chopin Institute lists over eighty societies worldwide devoted to the composer and his music.

The vast majority of bows are used with string instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, and bass, although some bows are used with musical saws and other bowed idiophones.
A bow consists of a specially shaped stick with other material forming a ribbon stretched between its ends, which is used to stroke the string and create sound.
Bowing
The question of when and where the bow was invented is of interest because the technique of using it to produce sound on a stringed instrument has led to many important historical and regional developments in music, as well as the variety of instruments used.
The earliest Chinese source of the pipe zither yazheng, bowed with a stick, is from the 8th century.
Bachmann notes evidence from a 10th-century Central Asian wall painting for bowed instruments in what is now the city of Kurbanshaid in Tajikistan.

Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics.
For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks.
Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting.
There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples.
Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production.
In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 metres (6 to 15 feet) tall in cultivation and up to 15 m (49 ft) in the wild, though more typically 2 to 10 m (6.5 to 33 ft).
The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii.
The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4,000–10,000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (M.
Chinese soft apples, such as M.
Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.
Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted.
An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the ""best"" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century.
In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.
Apples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit.
Depending on tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear 40–200 kg (90–440 lb) of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years.
For storage longer than about six months the apples are picked earlier, before full ripeness, when ethylene production by the fruit is low.
Apple trees are susceptible to fungal and bacterial diseases, and to damage by insect pests.
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars (cultivated varieties) of apples.
The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent.
The UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same ""genetic"" apple cultivar.
Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider.
Among their recent well known apples is the 'SnapDragon' cultivar released in 2013.
The third most grown apple cultivar in the United States is the 'Honeycrisp', released by the University of Minnesota program in 1991.
Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp.
Other desirable qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.
Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time.
The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits.
Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.
Organic apples are commonly produced in the United States.

Although some types of fore and aft rigs have yards, the term is usually used to describe the horizontal spars used on square rigged sails.
In order to set and stow the square sails, the crew must climb aloft and spread out along the yards.
The yard exists to allow square sails to be set to drive the ship.
As well as the square-rig yard, the traditional lateen rig is a triangular sail rigged fore and aft from a long yard mounted at an angle (downward sloping forward) from the mast.
The spar at the head of a lug sail – a roughly square sail which is set fore-and-aft but requires different handling from a more modern gaff or Bermuda rig – is known as a yard, and probably developed from the original square-rig yard.
The actual time that the sun would pass a particular yard would depend greatly on the ship's latitude and heading, as well as the height of her masts, but the phrase seems to have originated in the north Atlantic, where, in summer, this would have typically been at about 11 a.m. This was the time at which, by custom and rule, the first rum ""tot"" of the day was issued to men (the senior rates had their tots neat, while the junior rates had theirs diluted with water), hence its connection with taking one's first alcoholic drink of the day.

The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον 'sleeping place') implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs.
The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard.
Neolithic cemeteries are sometimes referred to by the term ""grave field"".
During the Early Middle Ages, the reopening of graves and manipulation of the corpses or artifacts contained within them was a widespread phenomenon and a common part of the life course of early medieval cemeteries across Western and Central Europe.
The shift to municipal cemeteries or those established by private companies was usually accompanied by the establishing of landscaped burial grounds outside the city (e.g. extramural).
The urban cemetery is a burial ground located in the interior of a village, town, or city.
Early urban cemeteries were churchyards, which filled quickly and exhibited a haphazard placement of burial markers as sextons tried to squeeze new burials into the remaining space.
Not all urban cemeteries engaged in re-use of graves, and cultural taboos often prevented it.
Many urban cemeteries are characterized by multiple burials in the same grave.
It was not uncommon for an urban cemetery to begin adding soil to the top of the cemetery to create new burial space.
While cemeteries often have grassed areas between graves, the layout of graves makes it difficult to use modern equipment such as ride-on lawn mowers in the cemetery.
The rural cemetery or garden cemetery is a style of burial ground that uses landscaping in a park-like setting.
Typically, lawn cemeteries comprise a number of graves in a lawn setting with trees and gardens on the perimeter.
In practice, while families are often initially attracted to the uncluttered appearance of a lawn cemetery, the common practice of placing flowers (sometimes in vases) and increasingly other items (e.g. small toys on children's graves) re-introduces some clutter to the cemetery and makes it difficult to use the larger mowers.
While cemetery authorities increasingly impose restrictions on the nature and type of objects that can be placed on lawn graves and actively remove prohibited items, grieving families are often unwilling to comply with these restrictions and become very upset if the items are removed.
Another problem with lawn cemeteries involves grass over-growth over time: the grass can grow over and cover the plaque, to the distress of families who can no longer easily locate the grave.
Commemorative plaques (usually standardised in terms of size and materials similar to lawn cemeteries) stand on these beams adjacent to each grave.
As in a lawn cemetery, grass grows over the graves themselves.
A natural cemetery, eco-cemetery, green cemetery or conservation cemetery, is a new style of cemetery as an area set aside for natural burials (with or without coffins).
In keeping with the intention of ""returning to nature"" and the early re-use potential, natural cemeteries do not normally have conventional grave markings such as headstones.
Columbarium walls are a common feature of many cemeteries, reflecting the increasing use of cremation rather than burial.
Columbarium walls are a very space-efficient use of land in a cemetery compared with burials and a niche in a columbarium wall is a much cheaper alternative to a burial plot.
As with graves, the niches may be assigned by the cemetery authorities or families may choose from the unoccupied niches available.
There is also the practice of families with large estates choosing to create private cemeteries in the form of burial sites, monuments, crypts, or mausoleums on their property; the mausoleum at Fallingwater is an example of this practice.
Graves are terraced in Yagoto Cemetery, which is an urban cemetery situated in a hilly area in Nagoya, Japan, effectively creating stone walls blanketing hillsides.
Placing burning grave candles on the cemetery to commemorate the dead is a very common tradition in Catholic nations, for example, Poland.
Traditionally, cemetery management only involves the allocation of land for burial, the digging and filling of graves, and the maintenance of the grounds and landscaping.
The cemetery caretakers fill the grave after the burial, generally after the mourners have departed.
As a single grave is now dug to 54 inches (140 cm), old cemeteries contain many areas where new single graves can be dug on ""old ground"".
In order to physically manage the space within the cemetery (to avoid burials in existing graves) and to record locations in the burial register, most cemeteries have some systematic layout of graves in rows, generally grouped into larger sections as required.
Often the cemetery displays this information in the form of a map, which is used both by the cemetery administration in managing their land use and also by friends and family members seeking to locate a particular grave within the cemetery.[3]
For cemeteries without space for new burials, the options are even more limited.
People with family buried in local cemeteries are usually quite concerned about neglect of cemetery maintenance and will usually argue in favour of public subsidy of local cemetery maintenance, whereas other people without personal connection to the cemetery often argue that public subsidies of private cemeteries is an inappropriate use of their taxes.
In many larger towns and cities, the older cemeteries which were initially considered to be large often run out of space for new burials and there is no vacant adjacent land available to extend the cemetery or even land in the same general area to create new cemeteries.
However, people often wish to be buried in the same cemetery as other relatives, and are not interested in being buried in new cemeteries with which there is no sense of connection to their family, creating pressure to find more space in existing cemeteries.
All of these issues tend to put pressure on the re-use of grave sites within cemeteries.
On the other hand, cemetery authorities are well aware that many old graves are forgotten and not visited and that their re-use will not cause distress to anyone.
However, there may be some older graves in a cemetery for whom there are local and vocal descendants who will mount a public campaign against re-use.
Sometimes the cemetery authorities request a further payment to avoid re-use of a grave, but often this backfires politically.
Some cemeteries did foresee the need for re-use and included in their original terms and conditions a limited tenure on a grave site and most new cemeteries follow this practice, having seen the problems faced by older cemeteries.
However, even when the cemetery has the legal right to re-use a grave, strong public opinion often forces the authorities to back down on that re-use.

yard,He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind .,['d011.s147.t002'],['yard%1:23:00::'],['a unit of length equal to 3 feet; defined as 91.44 centimeters; originally taken to be the average length of a stride'],"On a residential area, a front yard (United States, Canada, Australia) or front garden (United Kingdom, Europe) is the portion of land between the street and the front of the house.
The area behind the house, usually more private, is the back yard or back garden.
In North America, front yards, which normally include considerable driveway and parking space, tend to be mostly lawn even when large, but in Europe they are often treated as a flower garden and may be heavily planted.
While the front yard's counterpart, the backyard, is often dominated by utilitarian features like vegetable gardens, tool sheds, and clothes lines, the front yard is often a combination decorative feature and recreation area.
Depending on climate, local planning regulations or size, a front yard may feature a lawn or grassed area, a driveway or footpath or both and gardens or a vegetable patch or potted plants.
The history of the Australian front yard is said to have begun with a regulation enacted in New South Wales in 1829 mandating that new houses be built at least 14 ft (4.3 m) from the street to ensure adequate space in front of each house for a garden.
There was also, by then, a very clear street-view approach to garden design with the house façade and front yard considered in unison; to ""view the whole effect from the street"".
In the post-war era, suburban Canada gained its own distinctive architectural styles and this extended to front yards and gardens.
The provision of a front garden in new houses became common practice during the second half of the 19th century as part of the Domestic Revival style within Victorian architecture: ""to provide for the majority of new, even fairly modest, houses, a small front garden or paved forecourt, and a garden or yard at the back""."
