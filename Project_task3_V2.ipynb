Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator sport.\\nLouis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume (\\\"game of the palm\\\"), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style.\\nHe produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game \\u2013 and most importantly you had his rules.\\nTennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships date to 1891, although until 1925 they were open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs.\\nC. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences.\\nIn 1968, commercial pressures and rumours of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their living from tennis.\\nTournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.\\nThe line that runs across the centre of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side.\\nA legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server's court, before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net.\\nA game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving.\\nThe score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first.\\nIf one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played.\\nIf the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6\\u20136) a tiebreak is played.\\nA tiebreak, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7\\u20136.\\nIf a tiebreak is not played, the set is referred to as an advantage set, where the set continues without limit until one player leads by a two-game margin.\\nOn the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments.\\nIn these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches.\\nIn tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase \\\"Game, set, match\\\" followed by the winning person's or team's name.\\nA game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game.\\nFor example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40\\u2013love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game.\\nGame points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.\\nThe first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points.\\nMatch tiebreaks are used in the Hopman Cup, Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.\\n\\\"Australian doubles\\\", another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the Canadian doubles style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game, each player taking a turn at playing alone against the other two.\\nAs such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving.\\nWheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility.\\nShould a player be deemed to be stalling repeatedly, the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of \\\"point\\\", \\\"game\\\", and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit.\\nIn the event of a rain delay, darkness or other external conditions halting play, the match is resumed at a later time, with the same score as at the time of the delay, and each player at the same end of the court as when rain halted play, or as close to the same relative compass point if play is resumed on a different court.\\nBalls wear out quickly in serious play and, therefore, in ATP and WTA tournaments, they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games, because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up.\\nThis has been introduced in women's tennis for WTA Tour events in 2009 and allows the player to request her coach once per set.\\nIt is commonly used in modern tennis especially by \\u2018top professional players on the forehand\\u2019.\\nCompetent tennis players have eight basic shots in their repertoire: the serve, forehand, backhand, volley, half-volley, overhead smash, drop shot, and lob.\\nSome servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve.\\nA difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player.\\nCommon tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net.\\nThere are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis.\\nIn November at the end of the tennis year, the world's top eight players compete in the ATP Finals, a tournament with a rotating locale.\\nThese tournaments also contribute towards a player's ATP rankings points.\\nIn the Open Era, several female players such as Martina Navratilova, Margaret Court, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams, and Venus Williams (the latter two sisters playing together) have been prolific at both singles and doubles events throughout their careers.\\nThe Open Era, particularly the men's side, has seen many top-ranked singles players that only sparingly compete in doubles, while having \\\"doubles specialists\\\" who are typically being eliminated early in the singles draw but do well in the doubles portion of a tournament.\\nUnlike professional tennis tournaments (see below) where singles players receive much more prize money than doubles players, an Olympic medal for both singles and doubles has similar prestige.\\nIn professional tennis tournaments such as Wimbledon, the singles competition receives the most prize money and coverage, followed by doubles, and then mixed doubles usually receive the lowest monetary awards.\\nA frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time.\\nAndre Agassi, was the first player to complete the Career Grand Slam on all modern three surfaces (hard, grass, and clay courts) as previous winners of Grand Slam tournaments played in an era of grass and clay only (Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall also won major Pro tournaments on the three surfaces).\\nIn March 2012 the Tennis Channel published a combined list of the 100 greatest men and women tennis players of all time.\\nSportswriter John Wertheim of Sports Illustrated stated in an article in July 2010 that Serena Williams is the greatest female tennis player ever with the argument that \\\"Head-to-head, on a neutral surface (i.e. hard courts), everyone at their best, I can't help feeling that she crushes the other legends.\\\".\\nIn a reaction to this article Yahoo sports blog Busted Racket published a list of the top-10 women's tennis players of all time placing Martina Navratilova in first spot.\\nBillie Jean King said in 1999, \\\"Steffi is definitely the greatest women's tennis player of all time.\\\" Martina Navratilova has included Graf on her list of great players.\\nTennis writer Steve Flink, in his book The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century, named her as the best female player of the 20th century, directly followed by Martina Navratilova.\\nTennis historian and journalist Bud Collins has called Navratilova \\\"arguably, the greatest player of all time.\\\" Billie Jean King said about Navratilova in 2006, \\\"She's the greatest singles, doubles and mixed doubles player who's ever lived.\\\"\\nIn 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena Williams as the greatest female tennis player in the Open Era. In May 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of all time.\\nIn professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tiebreak to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review.\\nWhen called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact.\\nThese players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.\\nOveruse is also common in tennis players of all levels.\\nAssociation of Tennis Players (ATP) \\u2013 men's professional tennis organization\",\n          \"In common usage, particularly in English language teaching, particular tense\\u2013aspect\\u2013mood combinations such as \\\"present progressive\\\" and \\\"conditional perfect\\\" are often referred to simply as \\\"tenses\\\".\\nVerb tenses are inflectional forms which can be used to express that something occurs in the past, present, or future.\\nHowever the same forms are quite often also used to refer to future circumstances, as in \\\"He's coming tomorrow\\\" (hence this tense is sometimes referred to as present-future or non-past).\\nFor certain grammatical contexts where the present tense is the standard way to refer to the future, see conditional sentences and dependent clauses below.\\nIn a present indicative construction, the finite verb appears in its base form, or in its -s form if its subject is third-person singular.\\nFor specific uses of present tense constructions, see the sections below on simple present, present progressive, present perfect, and present perfect progressive.\\nPast tense forms express circumstances existing at some time in the past, although they also have certain uses in referring to hypothetical situations (as in some conditional sentences, dependent clauses and expressions of wish).\\nCertain uses of the past tense may be referred to as subjunctives; however the only distinction in verb conjugation between the past indicative and past subjunctive is the possible use of were in the subjunctive in place of was.\\nFor specific uses of past tense constructions, see the sections below on simple past, past progressive, past perfect, and past perfect progressive.\\nEnglish lacks a morphological future tense, since there is no verb inflection which expresses that an event will occur at a future time.\\nFor specific uses of future constructions formed with will/shall, see the sections below on simple future, future progressive, future perfect, and future perfect progressive.\\nThe morphological present tense can be used to refer to future times, particularly in conditional sentences and dependent clauses.\\n\\\"Simple\\\" forms of verbs are those appearing in constructions not marked for either progressive or perfect aspect (I go, I don't go, I went, I will go, etc., but not I'm going or I have gone).\\nThey may also denote a temporary state (imperfective aspect), in the case of stative verbs that do not use progressive forms (see below).\\nFor uses of specific simple constructions, see the sections below on simple present, simple past, simple future, and simple conditional.\\nIt is expressed using the auxiliary verb to be together with the present participle (-ing form) of the main verb: I am reading; Were you shouting?; He will be sitting over there.\\nTheir non-progressive forms (simple or non-progressive perfect constructions) are used in many situations even when expressing a temporary state.\\nThe verb to have does not use progressive forms when it expresses possession, broadly understood (I have a brother, not *I'm having a brother), but it does use them in its active meanings (I'm having a party; She's having a baby; He was having a problem starting his car).\\nOther verbs expressing a state of possession or similar, such as possess, own, belong and owe, also do not normally use progressive forms.\\nFor specific uses of progressive (continuous) constructions, see the sections below on present progressive, past progressive, future progressive, and conditional progressive.\\nIt is expressed using a form of the auxiliary verb have (appropriately conjugated for tense etc.) together with the past participle of the main verb: She has eaten it; We had left; When will you have finished?\\nThe implications of the present perfect (that something occurred prior to the present moment) are similar to those of the simple past, although the two forms are generally not used interchangeably\\u2014the simple past is used when the time frame of reference is in the past, while the present perfect is used when it extends to the present.\\nFor all uses of specific perfect constructions, see the sections below on the present perfect, past perfect, future perfect, and conditional perfect.\\nBy using non-finite forms of the auxiliary have, perfect aspect can also be marked on infinitives (as in should have left and expect to have finished working), and on participles and gerunds (as in having seen the doctor).\\nAlthough all of the constructions referred to here are commonly referred to as perfect (based on their grammatical form), some of them, particularly non-present and non-finite instances, might not be considered truly expressive of the perfect aspect.\\nThis applies particularly when the perfect infinitive is used together with modal verbs: for example, he could not have been a genius might be considered (based on its meaning) to be a past tense of he cannot/could not be a genius; such forms are considered true perfect forms by some linguists but not others.\\nHere a form of the verb have (denoting the perfect) is used together with been (the past participle of be, denoting the progressive) and the present participle of the main verb.\\nIn the case of the stative verbs, which do not use progressive aspect (see the section above about the progressive), the plain perfect form is normally used in place of the perfect progressive: I've been here for half an hour (not *I've been being here...).\\nFor uses of specific perfect progressive (perfect continuous) constructions, see the sections below on the present perfect progressive, past perfect progressive, future perfect progressive, and conditional perfect progressive.\\nThe English conditional is expressed periphrastically with verb forms governed by the auxiliary verb would (or sometimes should with a first-person singular subject; see shall and will).\\nFor uses of specific conditional constructions, see the sections below on simple conditional, conditional progressive, conditional perfect, and conditional perfect progressive, as well as the section on conditional sentences (and the main article on English conditional sentences).\\nPassive voice can be expressed in combination together with tenses, aspects and moods, by means of appropriate marking of the auxiliary (which for this purpose is not a stative verb, i.e. it has progressive forms available).\\nThe passive forms of certain of the combinations involving the progressive aspect are quite rare; these include the present perfect progressive (it has been being written), past perfect progressive (it had been being written), future progressive (it will be being written), future perfect progressive (it will have been being written), conditional progressive (it would be being written) and conditional perfect progressive (it would have been being written).\\nThe simple past or past simple, sometimes also called the preterite, consists of the bare past tense of the verb (ending in -ed for regular verbs, and formed in various ways for irregular ones, with the following spelling rules for regular verbs: verbs ending in -e add only \\u2013d to the end (e.g. live \\u2013 lived, not *liveed), verbs ending in -y change to -ied (e.g. study \\u2013 studied) and verbs ending in a group of a consonant + a vowel + a consonant double the final consonant (e.g. stop \\u2013 stopped) \\u2014see English verbs for details).\\nThe past simple is also used without past reference in some instances: in condition clauses and some other dependent clauses referring to hypothetical circumstances (see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and \\u00a7 Dependent clauses below), and after certain expressions of wish.\\nThe past progressive or past continuous construction combines progressive aspect with past tense, and is formed using the past tense of be (was or were) with the present participle of the main verb.\\nFor stative verbs that do not use the progressive aspect, the simple past is used instead (At three o'clock yesterday we were in the garden).\\nThe past progressive shares certain special uses with other past tense constructions; see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing, \\u00a7 Dependent clauses, {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing, and \\u00a7 Indirect speech.\\nThe past perfect, sometimes called the pluperfect, combines past tense with perfect aspect; it is formed by combining had (the past tense of the auxiliary have) with the past participle of the main verb.\\nFor example, while it is incorrect to say *I have done it last Friday (the use of last Friday, specifying the past time, would require the simple past rather than the present perfect), there is no such objection to a sentence like \\\"I had done it the previous Friday\\\".\\nHowever, if the state is temporary and the verb can be used in the progressive aspect, the past perfect progressive would normally be used instead.\\nIt is formed by combining had (the past tense of auxiliary have), been (the past participle of be), and the present participle of the main verb.\\nUses of the past perfect progressive are analogous to those of the present perfect progressive, except that the point of reference is in the past.\\nIf the verb in question does not use the progressive aspect, then the plain past perfect is used instead (see examples in the previous section).\\nThe past perfect progressive may also have additional specific uses similar to those of the plain past perfect; see \\u00a7 Conditional sentences, \\u00a7 Dependent clauses, \\u00a7 Expressions of wish, and \\u00a7 Indirect speech.\\nThe simple present or present simple is a form that combines present tense with \\\"simple\\\" (neither perfect nor progressive) aspect.\\nWith stative verbs in senses that do not use progressive aspect, to refer to a present or general state, whether temporary, permanent or habitual.\\nIt consists of a form of the simple present of be together with the present participle of the main verb and the ending -ing.\\nCertain stative verbs do not use the progressive aspect, so the present simple is used instead in those cases (see \\u00a7 Progressive aspect above).\\nThe present perfect (traditionally called simply the perfect) combines present tense with perfect aspect, denoting the present state of an action's being completed, that is, that the action took place before the present time.\\n(It is thus often close in meaning to the simple past tense, although the two are not usually interchangeable.) It is formed with the present tense of the auxiliary have (namely have or has) and the past participle of the main verb.\\nThe choice of present perfect or past tense depends on the frame of reference (period or point in time) in which the event is conceived as occurring.\\nIt is therefore normally incorrect to write a sentence like *I have written a novel yesterday; the present perfect cannot be used with an expression of past time such as yesterday.\\nWhen the circumstance is temporary, the present perfect progressive is often appropriate in such sentences (see below); however, if the verb is one that does not use the progressive aspect, the basic present perfect is used in that case too:\\nIt is formed with the present tense of have (have or has), the past participle of be (been), and the present participle of the main verb and the ending -ing.\\n(A sentence without perfect aspect, such as I am sitting here for three hours, implies an intention to perform the action for that length of time.) With stative verbs that are not used in the progressive, and for situations that are considered permanent, the present perfect (non-progressive) is used instead; for examples of this see \\u00a7 Present perfect above.\\nThe term simple future, future simple or future indefinite, as applied to English, generally refers to the combination of the modal auxiliary verb will with the bare infinitive of the main verb.\\nUse of present tense rather than future constructions in condition clauses and certain other dependent clauses is described below under {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and \\u00a7 Dependent clauses.\\nThe modal verbs will and shall also have other uses besides indicating future time reference.\\nThe future progressive or future continuous combines progressive aspect with future time reference; it is formed with the auxiliary will (or shall in the first person; see shall and will), the bare infinitive be, and the present participle of the main verb.\\nThe usual restrictions apply, on the use both of the future and of the progressive: simple rather than progressive aspect is used with some stative verbs (see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing), and present rather than future constructions are used in many dependent clauses (see \\u00a7 Conditional sentences and \\u00a7 Dependent clauses below).\\nFor the use of the present tense rather than future constructions in certain dependent clauses, see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and \\u00a7 Dependent clauses below.\\nIt is formed by combining the auxiliary will (or sometimes shall, as above), the bare infinitive have, the past participle been, and the present participle of the main verb.\\nUses of the future perfect progressive are analogous to those of the present perfect progressive, except that the point of reference is in the future.\\nFor the use of present tense in place of future constructions in certain dependent clauses, see {{Section link}}: required section parameter(s) missing and \\u00a7 Dependent clauses below.\\nThe simple conditional or conditional simple, also called conditional present, and in some meanings future-in-the-past simple, is formed by combining the modal auxiliary would with the bare infinitive of the main verb.\\n(This is described in more detail in the article on English conditional sentences; see also \\u00a7 Conditional sentences below.) The time referred to may be (hypothetical) present or future.\\nThe conditional perfect construction combines conditional mood with perfect aspect, and consists of would (or the contraction 'd, or sometimes should in the first person, as above), the bare infinitive have, and the past participle of the main verb.\\nIt consists of would (or sometimes should in the first person, as above) with the bare infinitive have, the past participle been and the present participle of the main verb.\\nIn colloquial English, particularly British English, the present perfect of the verb get, namely have got or has got, is frequently used in place of the simple present indicative of have (i.e. have or has) when denoting possession, broadly defined.\\nAnother common idiom is the use of the modal verb can (or could for the past tense or conditional) together with verbs of perception such as see, hear, etc., rather than the plain verb.\\nIt uses the present tense (with future reference) in the condition clause, and the future with will (or some other expression of future) in the main clause:\\nIt uses the past tense (with the past subjunctive were optionally replacing was) in the condition clause, and the conditional formed with would in the main clause:\\nParticular rules apply to the tenses and verb forms used after the verb wish and certain other expressions with similar meaning.\\nWhen the verb wish governs a finite clause, the past tense (simple past or past progressive as appropriate) is used when the desire expressed concerns a present state, the past perfect (or past perfect progressive) when it concerns a (usually counterfactual) past state or event, and the simple conditional with would when it concerns a desired present action or change of state.\\nThis change does not normally apply, however, when the past tense is used to denote an unreal rather than a past circumstance (see expressions of wish, conditional sentences and dependent clauses):\\nThe tense changes above do not apply when the verb of saying (etc.) is not past or conditional in form; in particular there are no such changes when that verb is in the present perfect: He has said that he likes apples.\\nApart from the special cases referred to in the sections above, many other dependent clauses use a tense that might not logically be expected \\u2013 in particular the present tense is used when the reference is to future time, and the past tense is used when the reference is to a hypothetical situation (in other words, the form with will is replaced by the present tense, and the form with would by the past tense).\\nThe use of present and past tenses without reference to present and past time does not apply to all dependent clauses, however; if the future time or hypothetical reference is expressed in the dependent clause independently of the main clause, then a form with will or would in a dependent clause is possible:\\nThe main uses of the various nonfinite verb forms (infinitives, participles and gerunds) are described in the following sections.\\nThe present participle is one of the uses of the -ing form of a verb.\\nFor present participle constructions with perfect aspect (e.g. having written), see \\u00a7 Perfect and progressive nonfinite constructions below.\\nAn English irregular verb\\u2019s simple past tense form is typically distinct from its past participle (with which the auxiliary to have constructs the past perfect), as in went vs.\\nHowever, not all irregular verbs distinguish them from each other and their unmarked form (with which the particle to constructs the full infinitive, as in to go): the participle may use the simple past form as in to say, said, have said, or use the unmarked form as in to come, came, have come.\\nFor verbs with three distinct such forms in standardized Englishes (go/went/gone), many speakers use the same form for the past tense and past participle.\\nWith a few verbs (such as to see, to do, to ring and to be), the standardized past participle form is used for the simple past, as in \\\"I seen it yesterday\\\" vs.\\n(perfect infinitive; for similar constructions and their meanings see English modal verbs)\\nBesides its nonfinite verbal uses as a gerund or present participle, the -ing form of a verb is also used as a deverbal noun, denoting an activity or occurrence in general, or a specific action or event (or sometimes a more distant meaning, such as building or piping denoting an object or system of objects).\",\n          \"No Wikipedia summary found\"\n        ],\n

those who have pled or been found guilty of crimes at trial may be  sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.\\nA prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government.\\nOutside of the United States, prison and jail often have the same meaning.\\nIn New Zealand, the terms \\\"jail\\\" and \\\"prison\\\" are commonly used, although the terms \\\"correctional facility\\\" and \\\"prison\\\" among others are in official usage.\\nOfficially, the term \\\"correctional centre\\\" is used for almost all prisons in New South Wales and Queensland, while other states and territories use a variety of names.\\nIn Canada, while the terms \\\"jail\\\" and \\\"prison\\\" are commonly used in speech, officially named facilities use \\\"facility\\\", \\\"correctional centre\\\", \\\"penitentiary\\\", or \\\"institution\\\".\\nThe use of prisons can be traced back to the rise of the state as a form of social organization.\\nIn these facilities the inmates were given \\\"prison labor\\\" jobs that were anticipated to shape them into hardworking individuals and prepare them for the real world.\\nBy the end of the 17th century, houses of correction were absorbed into local prison facilities under the control of the local justice of the peace.\\nIt was the first facility to make any medical services available to prisoners.\\nThe turn of the 19th century would see the first movement toward prison reform, and by the 1810s, the first state prisons and correctional facilities were built, thereby inaugurating the modern prison facilities available today.\\nPrison reform movement\\nHe proposed wide-ranging reforms to the system, including the housing of each prisoner in a separate cell and the requirements that staff should be professional and paid by the government, that outside inspection of prisons should be imposed, and that prisoners should be provided with a healthy diet and reasonable living conditions.\\nDevelopment of the modern prison\\nThe notion of prisoners being incarcerated as part of their punishment and not simply as a holding state until trial or hanging, was at the time revolutionary.\\nThe first state prison in England was the Millbank Prison, established in 1816 with a capacity for just under 1,000 inmates.\\nBy the 1840s, penal transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was on the decline, and the Surveyor-General of convict prisons, Joshua Jebb, set an ambitious program of prison building in the country, with one large prison opening per year.\\nPentonville prison opened in 1842, beginning a trend of ever increasing incarceration rates and the use of prison as the primary form of crime punishment.\\nThe use of prisons in Continental Europe was never as popular as it became in the English-speaking world, although state prison systems were largely in place by the end of the 19th century in most European countries.\\nPrisons employ people to run and maintain the prison while keeping control of the inmates.\\n(In comparison, 19th-century prisons had large landings and cell blocks which permitted only intermittent observation of prisoners.) Smaller, separate and self-contained housing units known as \\\"pods\\\" or \\\"modules\\\" are designed to hold 16 to 50 prisoners and are arranged around exercise yards or support facilities in a decentralized \\\"campus\\\" pattern.\\nSome modern prisons may exclude certain inmates from the general population, usually for safety reasons, such as those within solitary confinement, celebrities, political figures and former law enforcement officers, those convicted of sexual crimes and/or crimes against children, or those on the medical wing or protective custody.\\nModern prisons often hold hundreds or thousands of inmates, and must have facilities onsite to meet most of their needs, including dietary, health, fitness, education, religious practices, entertainment, and many others.\\nAdditionally, prison medical staff play a major role in monitoring, organizing, and controlling the prison population through the use of psychiatric evaluations and interventions (psychiatric drugs, isolation in mental health units, etc.).\\nThis leads to a high demand for medical services, and in countries such as the US that do not provide tax-payer funded healthcare, prison is often the first place that people are able to receive medical treatment (which they could not afford outside).\\nSome prison medical facilities include primary care, mental health services, dental care, substance abuse treatment, and other forms of specialized care, depending on the needs of the inmate population and the willingness of the prison to provide for these needs.\\nSome prisons provide educational programs for inmates that can include basic literacy, secondary education, or even college education.\\nUnder the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the United States, all prison institutions offer literacy programs to expand inmates' educational opportunities.\\nA control unit or segregation unit (also called a \\\"block\\\" or \\\"isolation cell\\\") is a highly secure area of the prison, where inmates are placed in solitary confinement to isolate them from the general population.\\nPrisons for juveniles are known by a variety of names, including \\\"youth detention facilities\\\", \\\"juvenile detention centers\\\", and \\\"reformatories\\\".\\nIt was estimated that in 2011 more than 95,000 juveniles were locked up in prisons and jails in the United States (the largest youth prisoner population in the world).\\nWomen's prisons\\nMilitary prisons in the United States have also been converted to civilian prisons, to include Alcatraz Island.\\nThe United States government refers to psychiatric prisons housing federal inmates as \\\"Federal Medical Centers (FMC)\\\".\\nPrison population\\nIn 2021, the United States of America had the world's largest prison population, with over 2 million people in American prisons or jails\\u2014up from 744,000 in 1985\\u2014making 1 in every 200 American adults a prisoner.\\nIn the United States alone, more than $74 billion per year is spent on prisons, with over 800,000 people employed in the prison industry.\\nAs the prison population grows, revenues increase for a variety of small and large businesses that construct facilities, and provide equipment (security systems, furniture, clothing), and services (transportation, communications, healthcare, food) for prisons.\\nSome scholars, using the term prison-industrial complex, have argued that the trend of \\\"hiring out prisoners\\\" is a continuation of the slavery tradition, pointing out that the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution freed slaves but allowed forced labor for people convicted of crimes.\\nA 2014 US report found that this included 64% of local jail inmates, 54% of state prisoners and 45% of federal prisoners.\\nThe social system within the prison commonly develops an \\\"inmate code\\\", an informal set of internal values and rules that govern prison life and relationships, but that may be at odds with the interests of prison management or external society, compromising future rehabilitation and increasing recidivism rates.\\nIn the United States and Canada, prison agencies are often referred to as \\\"Corrections\\\" services for this reason.\\nOn the other hand, in many countries including the United States, the vast majority of prisoners are rearrested within 3 years of their release.\\nPrison reform organizations such as the Howard League for Penal Reform are not entirely opposed to attempting to rehabilitate offenders, but instead argue that most prisoners would be more likely to be rehabilitated if they received a punishment other than prison.\\nPrison reformers also argue that alternative methods are often better at rehabilitating offenders and preventing crime in the long term.\\nAlternatives to prison sentences include:\\nThe movement is associated with libertarian socialism, anarchism and anti-authoritarianism, with some prison abolitionists arguing that imprisoning people for actions the state designates as crimes is not only inexpedient but also immoral.\\nCrime, Punishment and the Prison in Modern China.\\nPrisons, Punishment and the Pursuit of
